# Complementary Cardano Subs

r/Cardano is our main subreddit, but we also have several complementary and community run subreddits in order to help maintain flow of information and adhere to the subreddit rules (outlined later in this guide):

r/Cardano_ELI5 The 'explain like I'm five' subreddit is for newbie questions (how to buy, how staking works, fees etc). Posts explain in detain and in laymans terms the various Cardano and blockchain related topics. Please make sure you read the guidelines on this sub, as it has a very particular format.

r/CardanoDevelopers Everything Cardano developer related. If you're planning on building in the ecosystem, you'll want to join this sub.

r/CardanoStakePools Here you can also learn all about running a pool and get more insight into the pools in the ecosystem. Stakepool advertisement is not allowed on the main sub, so if your an stake pool operator, you'll want to market your pool on the stake pools subreddit.

r/CardanoTrading \+ r/CardanoMarkets We **only** allow market discussion in our [daily thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/?f=flair_name%3A%22Daily%20Thread%22) on the main sub. If you're more interested in price discussion, the trading subreddits are a better alternative.

r/ada_meme We don't allow low value content like memes on this sub, instead visit this one.

**There are no risks staking on Cardano!**

* Your ADA is never locked. You're free send your ADA at any time.
* Your ADA is never moved from your wallet. You will always be in control of your ADA (read the above like 'What does it mean to ""stake"" your ADA?' to learn more).
* Your rewards are distributed by the protocol, so there's no possibility they can be withheld by a stake pool.

**There is no minimum to stake (though there is a staking key deposit of 2 ADA) and any ADA added to your wallet is automatically staked, including rewards (rewards are compounded). You only need to withdraw rewards if you need to send the ADA out of your wallet.**

* [AdaTools](https://adatools.io/)
* [Pool.pm](https://pool.pm/)
* [PoolStats](https://poolstats.org/)
* [PoolPeek](https://poolpeek.com/)

**When delegating try to:**

* Support pools that contribute to the community.
* Use wallets that allow you to select your own pool (like [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/)).
* Avoid staking with [large entities](https://adapools.org/groups) like Binance (It's bad for decentralisation and therefore the project).

&#x200B;

# Staking Fees

Comment command: `?fees`

**Staking Key Deposit**

When you make a delegation, it will cost you 2 ADA for a staking key deposit, plus the standard transaction fee (usually \~0.17 ADA). The key deposit is something you'll get back if you ever undelegate the wallet.

Stake Pool Fees

Pool fees are commonly misunderstood. Firstly let's clarify that pool fees are not a direct cost to you, the delegator! Fees are simply the pools share of rewards when they are distributed.

**Fixed fee**

This is a set amount of ADA the pool earns (min. 340 ADA). *e.g If the fixed fee = 340 ADA: If a a pool earns 20000 ADA, the pool gets 340 ADA, and it's delegators get 19,600 ADA.*

**Variable fee (aka pool margin)**

The variable fee is a percentage of rewards the pool earns. *e.g. If the variable fee = 1%: If a pool earns 20000 ADA, the pool gets 200 ADA, and it's delegators get 19,800 ADA.*

*Note treasury tax not included in examples for simplicity.*

**When making a delegation try to:**

* Support pools that contribute to the community.
* Use wallets that allow you to select your own pool (like [Daedalus](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/)).
* Avoid staking with [large entities](https://adapools.org/groups) like Binance (It's bad for decentralisation and therefore the project).

# Rewards

There are 3 incentive mechanisms that allow the community to earn rewards in ADA:

**Staking Rewards**

Staking is incentivised as it's important for network function as intended. See:

* [What does it mean to ""stake"" your ADA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/kwmli8/what_does_it_mean_to_stake_your_ada/)
* [Rewards FAQ](https://cardano-community.github.io/support-faq/#/rewards)
* [Staking Calculator](https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator)
* [Where do staking rewards come from?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardano_ELI5/comments/l0190d/where_do_staking_rewards_come_from/)

Simply delegate your ADA in a Shelley wallet and you'll earn a passive income!

*Note that when you initially delegate, it'll take 15-20 days until you first receive rewards depending on your pool's performance, then every 5 days after (see rewards FAQ).*

Your rewards depend on the balance during the epoch snapshot (as detailed in the FAQ). That means:

* Rewards are compounded - rewards are added to your main balance and thus are captured in the next epoch snapshot which goes through the delegation cycle for increased rewards.
* Any additional ADA you add to the wallet increases your rewards (again once the balance has been captured in a snapshot and has gone through the delegation cycle).

**Community Advisor Rewards**

In [Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) you can earn rewards be writing thoughful reviews on proposal projects as a community advisor.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/26/2023,"Hello Cardano Family!

&#x200B;

This is ErgoMinnow (maybe some of you will recognize me from twitter).

I'm just wanting to make a quick post letting you all know that the Rosen Bridge from Ergo to Cardano is now live with public testing taking place today!

You can use ADA and Hosky on Cardano and ERG and Comet on Ergo.

This bridge is open source, trustless and permissionless.

Please DYOR and KYA when using the bridge.

As to my understanding, one of the coolest things about Rosen is that it only utilizes Ergo's smart contracts which lowers the potential attack vector on the bridge. There is no need to worry about the security assumptions of the other chain it connects to (not that I think Cardano has poor security).

Look into it for yourselves folks! A lot of us in the Ergo community believe this could become the back-end hub of interoperability in the crypto space!

4/26/2023,"Two years in Cardano and I’m finally getting brave. Made my first swaps on sundaeswap today. On one hand, I felt sad for digging into my stash for some Meld and AADA. On the other hand, i had to keep telling myself I never left the ecosystem. I can easily get it all back anytime I want. Hope I made the right move!"
4/27/2023,Is it necessary to revoke or limit smart contracts after using dapps on Cardano ? I noticed in my wallet it was possible to delete the dapp connection to a dex but I'm uncertain if that also revoked the smart contract. On many other chains like Eth this is possible but I haven't been able to find it for Cardano. Thanks in advance.

4/26/2023,"ETH changed its roadmap. They choose Proto-Danksharding instead of Sharding. 

Is Proto-Danksharding a good solution for scalability? 

Can we learn form this solution?"
4/26/2023,"For those who are interested in attending the Foreon Network AMA session hosted by Cardano Daily, could you please provide some details about the participants, such as the key speakers from the Foreon Network team, the topics that will be covered during the event, and any special guests or Cardano community members who might be joining the conversation?

&#x200B;

Additionally, will there be an opportunity for attendees to ask questions directly to the team or engage in a live discussion about the project and its future plans?"
4/26/2023,"Cardano's security is based on ADA coins' distribution and market value. This is based on the assumption that one entity cannot quickly and cheaply acquire a supermajority of all coins. The demand for ADA coins increases the market value, making a potential attack more expensive. There is one clever attack vector. It is possible to create a DeFi service offering a higher yield than delegators can get for staking ADA. For example, it could be a lending platform that offers a 10% yield for the ADA coins you provide to the service. Such a DeFi service would directly compete with staking. The service would siphon ADA from the staking and thus theoretically weaken the security of the PoS protocol. Can an attacker get the required number of ADA coins to attack in this way?

# TLDR

Trying to obtain a supermajority of PoS coins through the DeFi service is a theoretically possible attack, but very likely unfeasible in practice. The attack would be very costly and it would be necessary to create the most attractive service on the market.

As a non-technical investor in ADA.. What can I realistically do to support the adoption and growth of the network?

I'm not educated enough in how it works to post online about it - nor do I want to be labelled a shill...

I guess my question is:  Are there services/products/tools/etc I should consider using that will in some way support the cause?"

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

4/25/2023,"# Cardano Over Coffee ☕☕ W/ Charli3 Cardano's decentralized oracle

Charli3 Oracles - In a direct response to the scaling issues plaguing Ethereum, #cardano  (ADA) was developed as a quicker, inexpensive, and more secure blockchain infrastructure.

ADA is also one of the only Blockchain projects that has been built via a peer-reviewed and researched based approach.  For an oracle built on Cardano this means the backbone of its network is built on a trusted, open source foundation adding another layer of trust for users.

Charli3 is the first decentralized oracle network for the Cardano blockchain. By being native to Cardano, Charli3 aims to avoid  the notable issues with flexibility, scaling, and growing transaction fees seen with Ethereum-based oracles while also building its foundation on a trusted network."

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

4/25/2023,"Here is an excerpt of our [recent article](https://promovercrypto.com/crypto-blog/the-evolution-of-cardanos-technology-and-features) detailing the historical development of Cardano and its revolutionary feature set:

Cardano is a third-generation blockchain network designed to be scalable, interoperable, and sustainable. The project is built using rigorous high-assurance formal development methods, with peer-reviewed research serving as its foundation. Cardano's strength lies in its openness and transparency, with all research and technical specifications being made publicly available. The project has been developed by…."
4/24/2023,"Did fund 10 start yet? I'm asking because I just registered my wallet for the Fund 10, but after scanning with the Catalyst App it immediately displays Fund9 and informs me that ""my registration will not be completed until the voting round starts on Sept 5, 2022.""

This is the second time something like this has happened to me. Please help?!"
4/24/2023,"The more blockchain networks are ready for mass adoption, the more community members will ask how to help projects get more people interested in and using them. People don't care about technological details or decentralization. Even the majority of the population doesn't think that fiat money is a problem that needs to be solved through cryptocurrencies or that replacing fiat money with cryptocurrencies will solve a country's specific problems. How to present Cardano, which is one of many other projects? From our point of view, it is time to show people how to solve specific problems and convince them of the benefits of moving to the blockchain. Within a few years, blockchain technology will be ready for mass adoption and disruption in many industries. The existence of technology does not necessarily mean that anyone will use it. The hardest step for Cardano will be to break into a real business. This essentially means disrupting current services and replacing or integrating with server-based applications. For this to happen, the people must demand it and the current gatekeepers must agree with the change. It makes sense to convince ordinary people of the opportunities Cardano offers, but alongside that, it is important to debate with businesses and governments.

# TLDR

DeFi is the best marketing for decentralization as it creates an alternative to existing financial services. Adoption by states and business is also important. Cardano has been adopted by the government in Ethiopia to build a decentralized identity and by Fortune 500 company Dish. Working use cases is also great marketing. Definitely better for the mass population than boring explanations of technological details.

4/24/2023,"I remember Charles talking about the book in one of his AMA few months ago. I found the tweet from IOG announcing it back in March 2021.
Any recent news?"
4/23/2023,"Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake revealed that the IP addresses of Ether stakers are monitored as part of a broader set of metadata as :
“deposit addresses, you can look at withdrawal addresses, you can look at fee recipients, you can look at IP addresses”

https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-researcher-says-staking-reveals-ip-address-sparking-privacy-concerns

Can someone from the Cardano Foundation or Charles confirm that Cardano does not monitor IP-address of stakers or other metadata ?

And what about the wallet Lace .
Does that also monitors IP-addresses as Metamask does now ? 
https://cointelegraph.com/news/metamask-will-start-collecting-user-ip-addresses/amp

ConsenSys, the team behind Ethereum wallet MetaMask, began collecting IP addresses in November. The policy amendment was made to ensure that the firm could comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies where necessary.

Possibility is high that Lace also collects the same IP-address info to comply with the KYC & AML policies .
As Charles spoke about even collecting digital ID for staking . The step before that is IP-address ."

Here is [the link to the full research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06014.pdf).

Personally, this is a mechanism I'd love to see implemented on Cardano ASAP after CIP-1694. Something like this needs to be in place before the market starts going ballistic again because there needs to be *some* prioritized transactions for Cardano to have serious DeFi. Trading IS time dependent. People need to have the ability for their trades to go through quickly. Tiered fees allows that to happen on Cardano while not excluding those that want to process a transaction with lower priority for a much lower and reasonable fee. This was an issue when Cardano DeFi first turned on in the peak of the previous market cycle (think SundaeSwap debacle...) and tiered fees will help prevent it from happening again."

Project Catalyst is featured in the latest **Cardano Foundation Annual Report** published this past week. Thank you to everyone who has been part of the program and has helped shape Catalyst to what it is today. If you want to dive into the full length of the report - feel free to download the copy directly [from CF pages here.](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/annual-report/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-96X6Zm2xmnpGMBOPCD6iWTYV9vDVW4cyXo5WXPRyz5wRPAMZPhJjNeZrl-r7a-ITsTpbNv)

## Updates from Catalyst Circle

 This is the latest update directly [from the Catalyst Circle](https://twitter.com/ProjectCCvX?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-96X6Zm2xmnpGMBOPCD6iWTYV9vDVW4cyXo5WXPRyz5wRPAMZPhJjNeZrl-r7a-ITsTpbNv) \- shared in their words:  


*""The Code of Conduct is the result of an extensive review process. We gathered valuable insights from previous Circle members and community input to create this document.*

*The insights we gathered served as a guide in formulating high-level expectations of ourselves and future Circle members. The Code of Conduct reflects the values and principles essential for Project Catalyst's success.*

*We recognize that our community consists of individuals with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. Therefore, the Code of Conduct creates a safe and inclusive environment where all members can thrive, contribute, and grow.*

*We encourage everyone to read and understand the Code of Conduct, as our collective responsibility is to maintain a positive and respectful community. The Code of Conduct will also serve as a reference for anyone who wants to join the Circle in the future.*

*However, our work is far from over. We had our first official working session to outline our Bylaws, where you will see much more of the input gathered from previous Circle cohorts and the community. The Bylaws are much more in-depth than the Code Of Conduct. Our goal is to build the framework of expectations and responsibilities of Catalyst Circle members so that when our time concludes, we can smoothly transition to CCv5 and give the newly elected members a solid foundation to start from.*

*We understand that building a solid foundation for the future of Project Catalyst is essential, and we take this responsibility very seriously. We aim to ensure that the Catalyst Circle will continue to serve the Cardano community to the best of its abilities, inspiring and supporting projects that will advance the Cardano ecosystem.*

*Thank you for your continued support and dedication to Project Catalyst.""*

## Voltaire Musings - Workshop Maybe?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tswjjrhss7va1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=531c143de0f58af4d81d3c39f1eefdc53814a797

CIP-1694 marks the first iteration of Cardano’s on-chain governance. Given its importance, achieving broad consensus is vital as Cardano looks to the future. To make that happen, it’s equally important the community conducts its own governance discussions and events. 

The recent [Cardano governance workshop in Colorado](https://www.essentialcardano.io/video/cip-1694-community-workshop?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-96X6Zm2xmnpGMBOPCD6iWTYV9vDVW4cyXo5WXPRyz5wRPAMZPhJjNeZrl-r7a-ITsTpbNv) in early March, and a recap online event on 30th of March, are good examples of this collaboration. Led by key contributors and thought leaders in the community, both workshops sparked deep engagement and insight gathering, capturing inputs from a broad spectrum of community interests and experiences. Participants engaged in a range of collaborative activities and discussions to refine and debate the on-chain governance system proposed in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/JaredCorduan/CIPs/blob/voltaire-v1/CIP-1694/README.md?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-96X6Zm2xmnpGMBOPCD6iWTYV9vDVW4cyXo5WXPRyz5wRPAMZPhJjNeZrl-r7a-ITsTpbNv). The workshops were productive, established a model for future community events, and highlighted the importance of collaboration and inclusivity in governance frameworks. 

The conversations on CIP-1694 thus far are only the start. Today, a grant program is opening up to support community workshops across May, June, and July 2023. The global community events will be punctuated by two workshops held in Tokyo, Japan, and Edinburgh, Scotland during June and July co-hosted by EMURGO and IOG. Edinburgh's event in July will wrap up the year's workshops and bookend the feedback loop on CIP-1694 design. Dates for each co-hosted event will be announced in early May.

# Project Catalyst is looking ahead - Recap

&#x200B;

Since Fund9’s end, the Catalyst team has been deep in research, discovery, and design mode. Holding many workshops with the community, a lot of 1:1s, and received additional user-centered feedback from fund surveys, social media, and beyond.  


There are a number of proposed changes for Fund10 that are going to be gradually shared over the weeks to come. Couple weeks ago, we began with looking at what an alternative path looks like for the assessments stage in Cardano's Project Catalyst. Then, we turned our collective attention to Challenge Setting. Recently, in its first, we reviewed the Catalyst technology stack and the path ahead.

Catalyst funding rounds have been on pause for a little while now. Thank you everyone for your patience and continued support as we've navigated these past months. 2023 is shaping up to be an important year for Cardano, and equally so for Catalyst. You’ll be playing a pivotal role.

## Weekly GitHub Repo Round Up

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems.

The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/21/2023,"Hi guys, 

I want to start deploying an ADA node, but I'm looking for some more info about it. Do you guys know where I can find node documentation besides the Cardano website? Also is there a place where I can find how many Nodes are already active?"
4/20/2023,"I had my ADA staked on Daedalus using a paper wallet for two years and had been earning rewards on FISH stake pool. Recently, I bought a ledger and moved all my ADA to the address of my ledger and decided to stake with FISH again, but this time I’m using Yoroi. I have yet to receive anything for two epochs now. Have I done something wrong? I know there is a lag time before rewards are earned, but I thought the lag time was two epochs?"
4/20/2023,"When I started learning about cryptocurrencies many years ago, one of the most strange opinions on social media was the claim that Bitcoin had no leader and that it was the best thing for decentralization. Some people even claimed that Bitcoin doesn't even have a team, or that Bitcoin is modified by anyone who wants to. As a programmer and expert in network protocols, I immediately knew this was nonsense. Yet to this day, many people still believe it. Charles Hoskinson and the IOG team are sometimes seen as the problem, but it's actually one of Cardano's greatest strengths. Most people in the cryptocurrency space don't understand decentralization. They don't know what a team can and cannot do with a running distributed network that is decentralized through coins or hash rate. The lay public may not know that every software in the world has a team of maintainers and a decision-maker. We will try to explain why a team of experts, scientists, and programmers is the best Cardano can have and how we will all benefit from it. 

# TLDR

The Cardano community should be proud of the IOG team and realize that the success of the project is dependent on the ability to improve blockchain technology and innovate. Unlike gold, problems of blockchain protocols can be solved. New features can be even added. If we want better money, it is comforting to know that we can improve a new financial system indefinitely.

# Why does blockchain need a team of maintainers?

There will forever be competition between blockchain projects. While this may stir emotions as people perceive it through the squabbles between communities, at a technological level it is an inevitable and even desirable phenomenon. Technological progress cannot be stopped. You can't say that a network protocol is done forever and will never need updating. It's just the opposite. For a protocol to remain relevant, it requires constant maintenance and keeping up with innovation. Obviously, the better protocols will win and the losers will be forgotten over time. It doesn't matter what your definition of better and worse is, because it's subjective. Some better form of an existing one will always replace its competitor because it is more effective at something. We all have this principle ingrained in us because it's how nature works. Whoever can better manage resources and adapt to new conditions in a given environment always wins.

4/20/2023,Can anyone explain in simple terms why my etrnl wallet suddenly has collateral ‘locked’ away. The total sum of my wallet is not available to me? How exactly am I supposed to access and use the full value of my own wallet and assets?
4/20/2023,"Hey,

I was wandering what you guys think about the general UX state of wallets in general and specifically in the Cardano ecosystem.

I have been in crypto for over a decade and it seems like wallet UX hasn‘t fundamentally improved. I have tried many, but at the end of the day they all have a different UI. 

I really like and support the idea of self-custodial wallets and there are some good ideas floating around how that weird feeling can be removed. 

Cardano is leading on so many fronts. For better adoption UX is key though. 

Any thoughts?"

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

why not make the τ parameter 10%, this will increase the profitability of stakers and pool owners since ROS has recently fallen to 3-4%"
4/19/2023,"The University of Edinburgh is going to measure the decentralization of blockchain projects and provide this information through an index (EDI). It will start with Bitcoin and continue with other relevant projects, i.e. Ethereum, Cardano, etc. The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) may thus become the first relevant source of truth when it comes to the degree of decentralization of individual blockchain projects. This is very important, as ordinary people may have no idea how difficult it can be to compare the quality of decentralization between projects. Blockchain communities have endless arguments about which project is the most decentralized. This information is also useful for regulators who can make evidence-based decisions based on the index. EDI can give us a very precise answer to the question of how well Cardano is decentralized compared to other projects. How can it turn out?

# TLDR

Cardano is the most decentralized network in the top 10 when it comes to the number of significant nodes in the network (block producers) and the holders of the expensive resource. Decentralization of PoS networks has improved slightly over the last six months while Bitcoin decentralization has been steadily declining for roughly 10 years. 

# Myths and Reality

One of the most widespread misconceptions in the blockchain industry is the assumption that the quality of decentralization depends on the number of nodes in the network. The blockchain network consists of distributed nodes that can be operated by anyone without the permission of a third party. However, the number of nodes in the network has only a marginal effect on the quality of decentralization. The main task of a distributed network is to distribute data (transactions and blocks) between nodes and share resources. The number of nodes in the network affects the efficiency of data distribution and availability. It also affects the reliability and availability of the network. It is almost impossible for data to be lost from the world if it exists on thousands of nodes and is constantly available. Each newly connected node is able to find peers and start communication at any time. The network cannot simply be shut down because there is no center (server).

**Cardano is an open-source blockchain project that was launched in 2017 to address the challenges of existing blockchains and develop a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better meets the needs of its users.**

# The Evolution of Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology has evolved from the **first generation (e.g., Bitcoin)** that provided secure cryptocurrency transfer to the **second generation (e.g., Ethereum)** that offered enhanced solutions for smart contract execution and application development. However, second-generation blockchains often face issues in scalability.

# Cardano: A Third-Generation Blockchain

**Cardano is considered a third-generation blockchain that combines the features of previous generations while evolving to meet the changing needs of users.** To ensure the highest security, scalability, and functionality, Cardano focuses on three core concepts: scalability, interoperability, and sustainability.

# Scalability

Scalability is crucial in ensuring that the Cardano network can process an increasing number of transactions as user demand grows. It provides higher bandwidth capabilities, allowing transactions to carry a significant amount of supportive data that can be easily managed within the network. **Cardano uses various techniques such as data compression and is working to introduce Hydra, which will enable multiple side-chain functionality.**

# Interoperability

Interoperability ensures a **multi-functional environment for financial, business, or commercial operations by enabling users to interact with multiple currencies across various blockchains.** Cardano is being developed to support cross-chain transfers, multiple token types, and commonly used smart contract languages.

# Sustainability

Sustainability is essential to ensure that the system is self-sustainable. To drive growth and maturity in a truly decentralized manner, **Cardano is built to allow the community to maintain its continuous development by participating, proposing, and implementing system improvements.** The treasury system is controlled by the community and is refilled constantly from potential sources such as newly-minted coins being held back as funding, a percentage of stake pool rewards, and transaction fees.

# Advantages of Cardano

Cardano offers several advantages over other blockchain projects. It uses formal methods, such as mathematical specifications, property-based tests, and proofs, to achieve strong guarantees on the functional correctness of core components of the system. **Cardano is written in Haskell, a secure functional programming language, and employs powerful methods for ensuring correctness of the code.** The Ouroboros protocol establishes rigorous security guarantees and was delivered with **several peer-reviewed papers presented in top-tier cybersecurity and cryptography conferences.**

**Cardano is energy-efficient as it is a proof-of-stake blockchain.** In contrast to proof-of-work blockchains, **Cardano requires much less energy and computational power, making it a more sustainable solution.** Cardano also handles upgrades differently than traditional blockchains, using a hard-fork combinator technology that ensures a smooth transition to a new protocol without erasing the previous history.

Decentralization is also a fundamental feature of Cardano. **It is maintained by** [**almost 3,000 distributed stake pools**](https://cexplorer.io/pool) **that are operated by the community.** All blocks and transactions are validated by network participants without any reliance on a centralized authority.

Finally, Cardano offers a functional environment for business use cases, providing a foundation for global decentralized finance to develop a range of DApps that can run using functional and domain-specific smart contracts, providing multi-asset tokens for any needs.

# Staking in Cardano

**Staking is a critical component of Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols, which allows users to earn rewards by holding and maintaining a certain amount of cryptocurrency in their wallets.** In PoS, the concept of staking refers to the process of locking a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral to become eligible to participate in the consensus process and validate transactions. In return, stakers earn rewards proportional to their stake, providing an incentive toto maintain the network and discourage malicious behavior. **The amount of reward a staker can earn depends on various factors, including the size of their stake, the length of time they've been staking, and the overall network participation rate.**

In addition to earning rewards, staking offers several benefits to network participants. For one, **stakers can help to increase the security and stability of the network by providing a more decentralized and distributed infrastructure.** By participating in the consensus process, stakers have a direct say in the governance and decision-making of the network, making it more democratic and transparent. **Furthermore, staking offers a more energy-efficient alternative to PoW protocols, as it eliminates the need for resource-intensive mining operations.**

# Conclusion

Cardano has emerged as one of the **best blockchain projects due to its focus on scalability, interoperability, and sustainability.** It offers several **advantages over other blockchain projects, including energy efficiency, decentralization, and formal methods for ensuring correctness.**

Cardano's Proof of Stake protocol **provides stakers with the ability to earn rewards while maintaining the network and making it more secure and stable.** With its emphasis on functional smart contracts and multi-asset tokens, Cardano is well-positioned to support a wide range of decentralized finance applications. **The unique features of Cardano make it a strong contender in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

4/18/2023,"Occasionally, Cardano FUD appears and people ask if this project deserves to have such a high capitalization and be in the top 10. I believe that blockchain projects are not here to fight among themselves for a higher market capitalization, but to provide utility to people. What is useful is decided by each individual according to their needs. Is the second largest social network less useful or less relevant than the one in the first place? It would be very foolish to claim this. Technology development is not a sport, so there is no need to compare success by rank. Blockchain development does not have a fixed goal but is a continuous process. The same can be said for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and the use of blockchain in the financial and other sectors. The ranking will constantly change and that's okay. So is ranking a completely irrelevant metric? You can't say that. So what does market capitalization ranking suggest?

# TLDR

The ranking is a reflection of many different factors and subjective reasons of those who hold the coins of blockchain projects. The adoption of blockchain is still at the beginning and everything can change quite fundamentally depending on many external events. Almost nothing can be predicted with a high degree of certainty. Still, we can conclude that Cardano deserves to be in the top 10 and there are many relevant reasons for that. The main reasons are liquid staking, decentralization, community, and the Plutus platform.

4/18/2023,"Is it possible to store an encrypted message on the cardano blockchain, ideally not limited in size such that the ""message"" could be an entire book?

You then would allow the holder of some NFT to decrypt and read the message, ideally even amend the message according to some predefined rules (maximum number of allowed characters).

I can think of an off-chain setup, where the user connects their wallet and the content of a website that I have created only is visible, when the connected wallet holds the NFT, but that isn't quite as sexy - it would allow the website admin to cheat and change the rules at anytime."

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

4/17/2023,"People don't see the Internet as an endless tangle of network protocols, but as a place where they can work, communicate and have fun. They say blockchain is going to change the Internet and we've even started calling it Web3. The idea of Web3 has one major problem. Should the backbone for Web3 be Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, or something else? Most people believe the future will be multi-chain. The team building the Lace wallet plans to support multiple blockchains, and it is very likely that Bitcoin and Ethereum will also be supported. Lace Wallet is not the first attempt in this area, but thanks to the IOG team there is a good chance that it will be one of the first to be reliable, secure, support many blockchains, and gain popularity among users. Lace can be a single gateway to Web3 for you. Users may not even know that the services they use run on many blockchains. The blockchain industry needs a multi-chain wallet for the next wave of adoption, and Cardano may have an advantage if Lace is it. 

# TLDR

Centralized exchange and lending platforms are multi-chain services with a multitude of custodial wallets. People use them because they can access many blockchains through a single account. If Lace Wallet offers similar services, decentralization will win. Bitcoiners can switch to Lace Wallet if they want to use DeFi services and thus they gain access to the Cardano ecosystem. Lace can onboard cryptocurrency users into the Cardano ecosystem if it offers what they want, which is security, simplicity, and the availability of a large number of services in one place.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/17/2023,"Hey guys I have my Ledger connected to Externl, of coarse ledger live and now Lace wallet. 

Ledger live which I barley use had my Ada balance wrong at almost 10k ada I only have 7kish but I fixed it by clearing the cache in live. 

Now Lace has almost everything wrong, lower balance, not all token, even the wrong stake pool. I fixed the stake pool, and the balance is almost right but missing some according to Externl and Ledger. 

Anyone know how to get my wallet synced right with my Ledger? 

Thanks in advance."

4/16/2023,"Okay, maybe not impossible, but it seems that none of the crypto tax tools have any support for Cardano NFT sales. I've tried several including Koinly, which is supposedly one of the best. A lot of these tools claim NFT support, but it's only for big (non CNFT) marketplaces like OpenSea. I minted and sold a lot of NFTs last year, and don't even know where to begin on how to calculate the taxes on them. Makes me want to give up, throw my ledger in a lake, and pretend I never got involved in CNFTs in the first place. If anyone has any else has found themselves in a similar situation, I'd appreciate any advice."

# Hello there, beautiful soul!

Hope this message finds you well.  


Weekly round up of all things Catalyst (+more) is here. Recently, we saw several teams present their close out projects. First was MLABS with [their CTL Blockfrost Backend](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xk-FRLQT6v8?feature=share&t=601). Second, DLT360 team came back to wrap up highlights of [their six Fund7 proposals](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xk-FRLQT6v8?feature=share&t=1309) catering to onboarding industries into platforms. This week we also learned more from Simon at DirectEd Foundation that [is bootstrapping donations](https://www.youtube.com/live/Mz1GEHwh2wE?feature=share&t=315) in education in Africa. Additionally, dcSpark has [done some outstanding job](https://www.youtube.com/live/Mz1GEHwh2wE?feature=share&t=1261) with legislative outreach in the US.  


Lastly, we’ve also checked out brilliant work done on creating onboarding playbooks into the ecosystem as well as looking at the wider impact lead generating opportunities. Catch [the segments here](https://www.youtube.com/live/Mz1GEHwh2wE?feature=share&t=1725). Thank you for your great work and we wish you great strides ahead.   


A week ago, we also welcomed Catalyst's [Lead Architect - Steven Johnson](https://twitter.com/SJCatalyst) who gave an end to end presentation on the Catalyst technology stack and road ahead. [Very much worth the watch](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xk-FRLQT6v8?feature=share&t=2189).

Since Fund9’s end, the Catalyst team has been deep in research, discovery, and design mode. Holding many workshops with the community, a lot of 1:1s, and received additional user-centered feedback from fund surveys, social media, and beyond.  


There are a number of proposed changes for Fund10 that are going to be gradually shared over the weeks to come. Two weeks ago, we began with looking at what an alternative path looks like for the assessments stage in Cardano's Project Catalyst. A week ago, we turned our collective attention to Challenge Setting. Last Wednesday, in its first, we've reviewed the Catalyst technology stack and the path ahead.

CIP-1694 is a crucial step in Cardano’s journey into the age of Voltaire, defining the future on-chain governance mechanisms of the blockchain, and helping to create a self-sustaining system built on community contribution and consensus. Matthias Benkort (Cardano Foundation) along with Addie Girouard, Jared Corduan, & Kevin Hammond (IOG) recently filmed a useful explainer video with an overview and discussion on CIP-1694.  


In it, they discuss community-driven enhancements to the current governance scheme, the future roles and responsibilities of Delegate Representatives, the Constitutional Committee, and Stake Pool Operators, how to define and safeguard Cardano’s guiding principles. And current thinking on the tooling and governance processes needed to get there.  


Take a deeper dive [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obFeC2JS_IQ) with an explainer video.  


Wish to dive even deeper? A great place to start is by diving into the [www.1694.io](http://www.1694.io/) portal, or catch the latest with the community initiative - Voltaire News! - [a collaborative community newsletter](http://bit.ly/voltaire-news) started by Governance Guild to help the community keep track of the CIP-1694 debate.

Mike played with some AI and came up with a very fun tool dubbed as Voltaire assistant. While limited in its functionality - a wonderful exercise in what could be the future of communication in difficult subjects.

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

https://preview.redd.it/mdjh3z7kruta1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc694c2f73d011dd7bdb46bd7554567e3e6d5531

One of this year’s primary objectives has been to help educate the community on the technical functionality required to run Catalyst. Part of that mission has been to increase transparency in the backend systems. Of course, with this comes the need to continue community collaboration, and we’re hoping to see members champion community co-creation as they help to build and suggest improvements to these systems.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

Previously covered, but still interesting:

1. Charles dropped a video on Markets and Contagion in which he revealed that Credit Suisse wouldn’t allow an account when he was with Ethereum b/c crypto was “too risky.” Bwahahahaha. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1637952165217185792](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1637952165217185792)

7. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)
8. Apparently, Sushi Swap DAO and its “Head Chef” just got served with an SEC subpoena and they’re asking the community for a $3 million defense fund (with potential for more). [https://forum.sushi.com/t/establish-sushi-legal-defense-fund/11813](https://forum.sushi.com/t/establish-sushi-legal-defense-fund/11813)
9. The crypto twitter meme response to the Sushi SEC subpoena was fast and brutal. [https://twitter.com/trhistorianelt/status/1638231852619104256](https://twitter.com/trhistorianelt/status/1638231852619104256)

11. Very interesting rumors that projects are sitting on 2-300 SEC subpoenas and dozens of Wells Notices. [https://coinpedia.org/ripple/xrp-price-have-the-xrp-bulls-and-whales-given-up-ahead-of-the-summary-judgment/](https://coinpedia.org/ripple/xrp-price-have-the-xrp-bulls-and-whales-given-up-ahead-of-the-summary-judgment/)
12. The IRS is asking for comments on NFTs as “collectibles” (apparently matters for long term capital gains and elsewhere). [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-27.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-27.pdf)
13. Sebastian Nagel reports they have a Hydra head open on Cardano Mainnet. [https://twitter.com/ch1bo\_/status/1638599596782899205](https://twitter.com/ch1bo_/status/1638599596782899205)
14. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action. Basically, the SEC has launched its full war against crypto. [https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1638660032324829184](https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1638660032324829184)

16. Brian Armstrong says the Wells Notice is focused on staking and asset listings. [https://twitter.com/brian\_armstrong/status/1638654192138199041](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1638654192138199041)
17. Kraken is also not having a great day. Operation Chokepoint 2.0! [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1638636382305546243](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1638636382305546243)
18. Report: The SEC is suing Justin Sun over TRX wash trading. Jake Paul and other celebrities are also being drug into the suit.

22. Emurgo signed an MOU with Pan-Atlantic University in Nigeria to support blockchain education and research. [https://twitter.com/wlstylr/status/1638989199583088641](https://twitter.com/wlstylr/status/1638989199583088641)
23. The US is trying to kill crypto. Hong Kong is investing millions in building a crypto hub. [https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1638499378691293185](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1638499378691293185)

25. Here’s Caitlin Long on the Banking Crisis. She is absolutely the most knowledgeable person on banking in crypto. If there is anyone I would trust on banking matters, it would be her. [https://youtu.be/QM5h1oybxPU](https://youtu.be/QM5h1oybxPU)
26. Here’s the wilder, more extreme take from Balaji. Interestingly, he and Caitlin disagree about how many big prints are left and they both say the position of the other could be right. [https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN\_lCI](https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN_lCI)
27. Wow. Did Cointelegraph really try to claim we have no self-custody in Cardano staking? [https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616](https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616)
28. Coinbase is updating its staking services (including those related to ADA) and says it will “acts only as a service provider connecting you, the validators, and the protocol.” [https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards)
29. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at. [https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-moves-to-on-chain-staking-for-tezos-cosmos-solana-and-cardano/](https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-moves-to-on-chain-staking-for-tezos-cosmos-solana-and-cardano/)
30. People are divided on whether GPT4 will swallow everything and if any skill matters right now other than prompt engineering. But, it looks like Cardano smart contract development is definitely on the radar for that conversation. [https://twitter.com/PoolShamrock/status/1639748637684105217](https://twitter.com/PoolShamrock/status/1639748637684105217)
31. The disparity in daily users between the fledgling defi projects in Cardano and the largest most established defi projects in crypto is shocking to some. [https://twitter.com/SubcriticalTV/status/1640058128300638208](https://twitter.com/SubcriticalTV/status/1640058128300638208)

33. People are very curious about how the CFTC knew what Signal text chains were on CZ’s phone. [https://twitter.com/BillHughesDC/status/1640400690349744128](https://twitter.com/BillHughesDC/status/1640400690349744128)
34. Some are already implying that the CFTC alleging a coin is a commodity in an enforcement action may be a long term blessing in disguise for crypto since at least it’s not the SEC. [https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1640371206644703232](https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1640371206644703232)
35. CFTC alleges some bad facts based on internal chat logs. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1640479998049124353](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1640479998049124353)

If I am not mistaken, these collectibles worked as a ticket that granted its holders a chance to later receive a Cardano Summit 2021 NFTs minted on the Cardano blockchain.

Does anyone know what happened to these NFTs? Were they minted and distributed as announced?"

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/13/2023,"They seem to have one of the fairest Token distributions and some great Tokenomics, with the majority of the tokens distributed to users of the Protocol. 

In addition to all of that, they have shown significant progress, they have launched products with real adoption in the Cardano blockchain, and they are constantly innovating and launching new products and features such as non-custodial yield farming.

4/13/2023,"So I made a newbie mistake and went NFT shopping without giving too much sort about privacy.

First: all NFTs I bought ended up in the same wallet - kind of obvious, because I didn't bother to use different wallets.

Second: Even though I used a HD wallet, on [jpg.store](https://jpg.store) I could see my wallet as the holder of all the NFTs I bought. First question: Does this have to be so? What is the reason? I understand that NFTs are linked to addresses, but in a HD wallet I can generate new addresses and each NFT could be linked to an individual address.

I understand that there is still the buying history on the blockchain. E.g. I fund a wallet with 100 ADA, I buy 4 NFTs for 25 ADA each, the purchase would still link the NFTs to one single address.

Third: Being the newb I am I than create more wallets and distributed my NFTs. My idea was: I can make the correlation between all the NFTs a bit less obvious at least.

\----

And now to my surprise, trying Cardano Scan and Cardano Explorer and [pool.pm](https://pool.pm), I \*\*was not\*\* able to start with the asset ID of one NFT, retrace the transactions I did to then find all the other NFTs.

Could it be that it's not possible to link one address to another by looking at transaction on the cardano blockchain?

I am well versed in Bitcoin but new to Cardano. If someone is willing to tell me what's going on, I don't mind technical details or just links to relevant documentation. I googled before asking here, but what I found left me more confused."
4/13/2023,"Paima Studio designed a blockchain game engine called Paima Engine. One of the most exciting concepts the team has created is Stateful NFTs. Most people view non-fungible tokens as an image linked to a token on the blockchain. Stateful NFT is a revolutionary concept linking a token to a dynamically changing state. Stateful NFT can store time, in-game experience, earned items or in-game money, etc. It can be seen as an account or a saved game position. I personally believe that this concept has potential outside of the gaming industry.

# TLDR

Scarcity itself is often meaningless without utility. The value of most current coins or tokens is based on artificially created scarcity. Stateful NFTs can store time, history, experience, luck, and similar things. This can be a game utility that players will really enjoy.

4/13/2023,"In the latest update vid by CH, he briefly mentioned that PLutus V3 is in the works.

As we know, V2 was the Vasil hard fork update, bringing collateral outputs, reference scripts/inputs and maybe few other things i don't remember.

I wonder what V3 is going to be about. Anyone has any info, or rumors what it could bring?

Maybe have a look through the current CIPs, to see if any of them are dealing with Plutus...?

When I quickly scrolled through the proposed CIPs, I've only seen these three CIPs about Plutus:

[https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip49/](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip49/) \- ECDSA and Schnorr signatures in Plutus Core

[https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip58/](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip58/) \- Plutus Bitwise Primitives

[https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip0381](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip381) \- Plutus Support for Pairings Over BLS12-381

(the 381 link on the [https://cips.cardano.org/](https://cips.cardano.org/) page is missing a 0, need to use my edited link)

There are also more Plutus-related CIPs that are still under review, but those are probably not nearly ready for release yet."

7. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/12/2023,is lace wallet built by cardano or its just a wallet built on top of cardano? im confused
4/12/2023,"Why are there not more light wallets for desktops being developed? All I'm seeing is atomic wallet and everything else is browser/app based. I was under the impression that lace would be able to run as a downloadable application that could run without the need for a browser. Is it much more challenging? I would love to see an application that operates like ToS(thinkorswim) in the cardano ecosystem, and I was hoping lace would be moving in that direction of things. I suppose my hopes were too high."
4/12/2023,"Would you like to improve the Cardano protocol? There is a process for doing this called Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). Through the CIP process, you can create a document in which you can describe the problem and propose a solution. CIPs should serve as the primary mechanism for proposing changes to the Cardano protocol. It is where authors, CIP editors, and the community meet. They can all debate the proposal. Proposals are usually submitted by experts and expertise is also expected from reviewers. If anyone is interested in detailed technological information, CIP documents can be a useful resource. People are sometimes confused and don't know how the CIP process and on-chain governance are related. The introduction of on-chain governance is proposed in CIP-1694. Let's take a look at it.

# TLDR

There is no direct connection between the current CIP process and the on-chain governance proposal as described in CIP-1694. However, CIP documents could serve as input for governance in the future. CIP documents would contain technical details about the problem and the ideal expert-approved solution.

Previously covered, but still interesting:

1. Charles dropped a video on Markets and Contagion in which he revealed that Credit Suisse wouldn’t allow an account when he was with Ethereum b/c crypto was “too risky.” Bwahahahaha.

14. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action.

27. Wow. Did Cointelegraph really try to claim we have no self-custody in Cardano staking? [https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616](https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616)
28. Coinbase is updating its staking services (including those related to ADA) and says it will “acts only as a service provider connecting you, the validators, and the protocol.” [https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards)
29. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at.

34. Some are already implying that the CFTC alleging a coin is a commodity in an enforcement action may be a long term blessing in disguise for crypto since at least it’s not the SEC.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/11/2023,"Cardano has 1.23B ADA coins in its project treasury. Every 5 days, 0.3% is taken from the reserve (currently about 9.32B) together with collected fees and both are used for the epoch reward. From this amount, 20% is taken and put into the treasury. That's roughly 5.5M ADA every epoch. As the reserve declines, so do the contributions to the treasury. It is expected that in the future the income from the reserve will be gradually replaced by the income from fees. Currently, roughly 20k ADA goes into the treasury each epoch from the fees collected. Cardano should be an ecosystem that will be able to finance itself. This way it can maintain its independence from VC funds and can remain in the hands of the community. ADA in the treasury belongs to the community, i.e. all Cardano stakeholders. Each ADA holder can decide what projects the treasury will fund.

# TLDR

The quality of decentralization is currently judged only by the number of pools, delegators, and validators. In the near future, we will be looking more and more at the quality of decentralization at the project management level, as people will be more interested in finding solutions to problems (like the security budget problem). People don't yet realize how important the project treasury is for decentralizing the blockchain and that the team needs to be in the role of employee, not a ruler.

4/11/2023,"Atomic wallet are running three pools, each with very low pledge. Even with a such a low pledge they have failed to keep their pledge in place in one of their pools, therefore all of these delegators of 26M ada will not receive any rewards.  


Please move your ₳ from these multipool operators with no 'skin in the game' and support a single pool operator with a decent pledge.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/11/2023,"Hi ,

I have done  withdrawal with the option ""Keep registered"" below (red marked).

I find now the stake address by the wallet when i go to receive ->rewards - but my question is how can i claim it when i want to send it away  for example exchange or another wallet??

[???](https://preview.redd.it/lem5n75ce8ta1.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01fedcf7d00b8d77ff0b9b7ae3b29c41d601e83f)"
4/11/2023,"So I've been watching the MAV and the % of delegated for each stake pool group and there has been a big change.

The Minimum Attack Vector, or MAV, sometimes known as the Nakamoto Coefficient (depending on who you ask) determines the minimum number of groups of Stake Pools that would need for block production to be compromised. It's been a while since it has been at 31. Last week i'm sure it was 26/27 or there about.

[https://cexplorer.io/nakamoto](https://cexplorer.io/nakamoto)

Similarly, both Binance and Avengers stake pools have decreased drastically in amount staked. They used to be well over 10% and are now under 9/8%. It looks like there has been a redistribution of staked amounts.

Thanks to info@meld who hand-held me in claiming the token and its staked rewards.  Now that MELD is safely stashed in my ETRNL wallet should I just leave SAM ON? Or should it be turned OFF again? I understand that that is the default setting when the App is downloaded, right? Appreciate any good and safe advice."

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/9/2023,"Hi all. Back in 2021 installed Daedalus and began staking some ADA. The ADA is on my Ledger. My issue is that Daedalus is now too large and won't open. Not only that, it won't let me install anything else on my computer due to size constraints. I want it gone. This snuck up on me, but I never got a chance to unstake my ADA. 

My question is this - what happens if I delete Daedalus? Am I able to spend this ADA I currently have? I don't appear to have been accumulating staying rewards, but I'm not sure if that's something that only displays in Daedalus. Obviously I don't want Daedalus to brick my computer, but I don't want to risk losing anything either. What's the best solution here?

Also, I'm a noob. Talk to me like I'm 5. Thanks."
4/9/2023,"If you are, this video interview with two Stakepool operators will be pretty useful, if you’re not it can still be interesting to learn more about this vital part of the validation of the Cardano blockchain: [https://youtu.be/42rj4R2Zz1o](https://youtu.be/42rj4R2Zz1o) 

Here we dive deeper into what it takes and what you should consider when starting a Stakepool, the biggest challenges you will likely face, and also how solutions such as the Optim Spo Bonds can be pretty useful in attracting delegation to start minting blocks and getting rewards consistently."
4/9/2023,"It's tax time and I have about 7 wallets. What's the easiest way to generate something to give to my accountant to account for all the staking rewards income for 2022? 

Thanks."
4/10/2023,"I was initially impressed with the rigor of the Cardano development team, but the it seemed to devolve into the same speculative nonsense as the rest of crypto. It’s been a while since I’ve paid any attention, so I’m wondering if any real social work is being accomplished on Cardano."
4/9/2023,Been looking around but not having much. Would anyone happen to know if there is a Cardano based blogging platform currently in development of production?
4/9/2023,"So I currently was transferring 77 ADA from robinhood to my yoroi wallet. However, after I minute or two I checked my yoroi wallet and it had added the 77 ada to my balance, but legit 30seconds later when I refreshed my wallet the 77 ADA was not included in my balance. When I go to the transaction tab in my wallet it shows the 77 ADA was receive (so i sent it to the right address) but for some reason it is no longer showing the 77 ADA in my balance. I one point I did see the status of the transaction on my wallet say failed but then it changed to high and completed. The ADA is no longer even on my robinhood account. I know 77 ADA isnt much but dont want something like this to happen when I send more ADA in the future.

I was wondering if this happened to you guys or if there is something I am suppose to do other then just wait and see if it eventually gets add back to my balance."
4/9/2023,"This is a question out of the ordinary things in this sub. But for tax and compliance purposes, I need to find my initial Cardano transaction. But I’m not sure where I first bought them as a very early adopter."

4/9/2023,What is the difference between Mina and upcoming cardanos side chain midnight? Are they the same thing?
4/8/2023,"Hi all,

I'm about to undergo my regular Windows reinstallation and I've been doing some research into what is required to move Daedalus. 

So, I've found a few bits, but just wanted to clarify - you know, given the potential risks.

I have Daedalus on my PC which I'm backing up (so I don't have to re-sync the whole blockchain again). My keys are secured on a Nano X which is synced and staked via Daedalus. I've noticed that my Rewards are associated to a 'Rewards Address'. 

Validation Questions are:

1. Having read a few bits of information, because my keys are safely stored on my Nano, I don't have to worry too much about that - is that correct?
2. As I don't have my keys stored on the Daedalus wallet, I don't have to worry about the seed phrase for that - correct?

Question I've not found an answer to yet (above two are more a validation of my understanding) is:

3. What am I doing with my Unspent Rewards? It says that it is in my Ledger Nano X on the left hand column of the Rewards tab, but then if I open Ledger Live, the amount of ADA I have in my wallet is 'off' by the amount in the Rewards Address. Do I have to transfer this?"
4/8/2023,Is this [news](https://u.today/cardanos-ada-ouroboros-leios-upcoming-upgrade-makes-transactions-10x-faster?amp) true? Will it actually make cardano 10x faster or just help with tps?
4/8/2023,I bought an album for testing and fun but I have no idea what to do with the NFT... I see the songs listed in the metadata but now what?
4/8/2023,I've started exploring more native tokens. What are your favorites?

4/7/2023,Is there no more voting? Or is there an app other that Catalyst?  Did voting stop after 2022?
4/7/2023,"What app will notify rewards earned like PoolTool?

The notifications in Pooltool used to work when the epoch ended but they are no longer working. 

Pooltool now requires an on chain transaction to verify or ID the account. I’d simply like to add an address to get this notification without transacting on chain with Pooltool.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/6/2023,"Who should decide who Cardano should have served best? Many people would answer that no one because a decentralized network should have no leader. They believe that the blockchain should be launched and then no major changes made. Another possibility is that all users who have skin in the game will make the decisions. Through democratic voting, they can collectively decide to change the protocol. One group may benefit from the changes, but the other may lose. The change may, in principle, satisfy only some, so it may cause an exodus of some users. Cardano will have on-chain governance. Let's think about what approach is most appropriate. Is Cardano heading in the right direction? 

**TLDR**

* Teams have essentially launched not only blockchains but also movements or communities of sorts.
* A protocol capable of change may suit the majority, but minorities may go elsewhere. 
* A change-resistant protocol cannot respond to changes in the external environment. It will either survive as it is or cease to exist. 
* The community needs to trust the protocol, and the only way to do that is to control it.
* As opinions differ on what the mission of the Cardano project actually is, opinions will differ on what new features to implement or how to improve the protocol.
* The mission of Cardano is linked to wider adoption, and so we do well to rely on the wisdom of the crowd.

One of the charts I saw was Exchange-Onchain Market Depth.  Does anyone know where i can view these charts?  I'm thinking that this info. would give me a better insight when to buy or sell.  Any comments would be great appreciated."
4/6/2023,"Staking rewards down into the 3% range. Any ideas when transaction fees will start factoring into the rewards scheme? Is there a protocol level threshold, or is this something that needs to be “turned on”?
Since Shelly the rewards have been cut roughly in half (about 3 years). For many this is an investment and returns matter. And detailed information is welcomed and should be considered a single source of truth. Thanks!"

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

No other program is running on my computer, and if any suggestions of a different wallet, I also use Nami and Yoroi. Pray for me, most of my Ada is on my Daedalus and I don’t want to have to spend a day just to access it….still love Cardano ✊"

40. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)

47. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/5/2023,"SHEN price seems to vary between 1.0 ADA and 1.12 ADA or so. Where does this price come from?

For DJED we know that there is an oracle that determines the exchange rate for ADA / USD und therefore also for ADA / DJED as 1 DJED can always be converted to ADA worth of 1 USD.

How is this done for SHEN? Is there also an oracle that tracks prices on various exchanges? There are only a few exchanges listing SHEN, so I can't imagine that's the way it works. Is it the smart contract himself that calculates the price for SHEN (based on what?) and thereby the exchanges follow that price by arbitrageurs?"

They want to be a decentralized Finance Hub, and for that, they have created and are developing different features that are innovative and extremely useful for the Cardano Ecosystem, such as the NFT and Token Staking Vaults, the VyFy Bar, and the Automated Yield Farming using Artificial Intelligence.

4/4/2023,"Are ADA holders just investors, or something more? Everyone can view it subjectively. Some are just pragmatic investors, some are investors and fans. Is there any other category? I'm sure there is. Someone can be more than just a fan. There is a group of people who see Cardano as an opportunity to create an alternative financial system and are actively involved in building it. It doesn't matter if they are developers, those who actively participate in social media debates or comment on CIPs. They can also be those who follow what's going on in the Cardano ecosystem. They are also those who use DeFi services. If you accept the fact that the financial system, or money if you like, is one of the pillars of states, we should think about what Cardano can become. If cryptocurrencies are to weaken the position of states, it is logical that people need to create some alternative. Is it too bold to think that new groups of people can emerge from decentralized networks that are more than just a community of fans? Can they call themselves citizens, for example? Let's flesh out these ideas more.

# TLDR

* Blockchain is more than just a protocol and a native coin. It's also a community. A community can be more than just a group of fans. It can be the basis for a new society. 
* Futurologists predict that corporations can replace states. Blockchain networks like Cardano are a better platform for replacing states than corporations. 
* Cardano will allow decision-making power to be distributed among all ADA holders. Money doesn't have to be a tool of the state, but a tool of the people to determine how the rules should be set.
* Success is not about individuals getting a financial boost from a profitable investment, but about the collective being committed enough to strive for change.

62. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano.

Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

4/3/2023,"The 1694 Constitutional Committee nomination process is essential for upholding the democratic principles that should guide our community. Upon reviewing the list of nominees [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHLsDptxCGURPyf9hSXvAwVtg9m-45g8VSS7l5g6d3E/edit#), I feel compelled to express my concerns regarding the variety of nominees and the reliance on a single platform for the nomination process.

My main suggestion to improve the situation would be to involve an external organization to conduct a thorough audit of our nomination process. This way, we can ensure that it is both transparent and equitable for all participants. After all, with the technology at our disposal, there is no excuse for failing to guarantee a fair and open process.

Additionally, to foster a more decentralized governance structure, it is vital to extend the nomination process to various platforms, rather than just relying on Twitter or any other closed platform. While Twitter is widely used, it would be more beneficial to include decentralized platforms like Mastodon in the process. By doing so, we can ensure a more inclusive and transparent nomination process that fairly represents the community's diverse perspectives.

Although expanding the nomination process to multiple platforms might present challenges in consolidating responses, the benefits of inclusivity and fairness outweigh these difficulties. In order to maintain impartiality, it is necessary not to tip the scales by favoring one platform over another.

By addressing these concerns and working together, we can achieve a more democratic and decentralized governance system, creating a stronger and more resilient community for the future.

1. Increase Brand Awareness: By exhibiting at non-crypto events, you can introduce Cardano to people who may not be familiar with cryptocurrencies. This can increase brand awareness and help Cardano reach a broader audience.
2. Targeted Audience: Depending on the type of event, you may be able to reach a targeted audience that is interested in topics related to blockchain, finance, or technology. This can provide an opportunity to educate potential users about the benefits of Cardano and how it can be used.
3. Networking Opportunities: Non-crypto events can be an excellent opportunity to meet people who may be interested in partnering with or investing in Cardano. By exhibiting at these events, you can connect with potential partners, investors, and other industry professionals.
4. Industry Insights: Attending non-crypto events can provide valuable insights into trends and innovations in other industries. This can help Cardano stay informed about the latest developments and potentially identify opportunities for collaboration or expansion.

4/3/2023,"Hi, I'm fairly new to the space. In fact, I just learned that Cardano existed 10 minutes ago. It was 2 minutes ago finding this sub that I learned that Cardano probably isn't a hacking/scamming organization. Let me explain.

Today I woke up to one of my favorite youtube channels (Angela's Symposium) taken over a supposed ""Cardano Foundation"". It has since been reclaimed by it's owners, but in the interim the channel was renamed and used to promote various dubious transactions. Looking through this sub, it seems like this is a thing that is known to occur, and that the position of the community here that while these are scams they are unrelated to the real Cardano. 

I would encourage the community here to consider that as long as outsiders like myself are more likely to come across actual hackers and scammers using this name than the real Cardano it may be difficult to amass the legitimacy and trust necessary for a project such as this. 

The imposters are still out there; a reputation is far FAR easier to lose than it is to earn back."

Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

# Hello there, beautiful soul!

Hope this message finds you well.  


Weekly round up of all things Catalyst (+more) is here. This week is especially exciting because the Catalyst team was able to share the second installment of proposed changes signaled for Fund10, specifically around Challenge Setting. We also saw  two amazing presentations discussing  [Auditability](https://www.youtube.com/live/PDqfSAf8m68?feature=share&t=1447) and [Nation Building Dapps](https://www.youtube.com/live/PDqfSAf8m68?feature=share&t=638). Congratulations to both Challenge Teams on completing the work and resurfacing some fantastic insights about projects funded under those topics. However, there's a lot more.  


So what's the latest? Let's dive right in.

Since Fund9’s end, the Catalyst team has been deep in research, discovery, and design mode. Holding many workshops with the community, a lot of 1:1s, and received additional user-centered feedback from fund surveys, social media, and beyond.  


There are a number of proposed changes for Fund10 that are going to be gradually shared over the weeks to come. Last week, we began with looking at what an alternative path looks like for the assessments stage in Cardano's Project Catalyst. This week, we turned our collective attention to Challenge Setting.

There would be no Cardano, much less even Catalyst, without dedicated community members around the globe.  


One of the shining examples are countless initiatives from different town hall teams. Recently, Africa Town Hall celebrated their 1st anniversary. What an achievement! Big kudos to everyone who has helped make this a reality and continues supporting ongoing efforts for education and adoption.  


Thank you, sincerely.  


Now, make sure to soak up their energy from the latest [town hall recording celebrations here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Sfl8XXE2U) You can also follow their work now [on twitter here](https://twitter.com/africa_townhall).

# Ariob Incubator Demo Day

https://preview.redd.it/208yytv5uira1.png?width=1752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=198fcc692ad696808dba3f40958913f71f39f3ea

On behalf of Input Output Global (IOG) and Iceaddis, we invite you to join us for the Ariob Incubator’s first Demo Day! Join us on Tuesday, April 4th at 4 p.m. UTC for the Ariob Incubator’s inaugural Demo Day.  


Last year, Project Catalyst launched the Ariob Incubator program in collaboration with Iceaddis, a pan-African incubator, and accelerator. This event is your opportunity to learn and directly connect with cutting-edge Web3 projects building on Cardano, many likely looking for additional guidance, support, or investment.  


The Ariob accelerator program is designed to elevate the most promising and impactful startups that initially found funding through Project Catalyst, whose primary focus is tackling real-life challenges across Africa. This five-month program has helped eight early-stage ventures refine their businesses and prepare for a select audience to mark the completion of the program.  


We look forward to showing you what we’ve been working on!! Learn more about Ariob: [https://ariob.io](https://ariob.io/) or catch this live stream placeholder link: [https://iohk.link/3KmpIvW](https://iohk.link/3KmpIvW)

   * This update to [CIP-30](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0030) attempts to add additional clarity and guardrails to the API extension mechanism recently introduced in [#446](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/446).

**RW:** Continued Recommendations:

* [CPS-???? | Voltaire era Governance](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/481):
   * This CPS tried to frame a set of motivations, goals, constraints, and open questions for the very broad topic of Cardano governance.
   * This is to accompany [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380) to allow for discussion of the problem of governance rather than the technical solution.
* [CIP-0045? | Decentralized WebRTC dApp-Wallet Communication](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/395):
   * This proposal describes a decentralized communication method between dApps and wallets based on WebTorrent trackers and WebRTC.
* This has seen some decent engagement and is an interesting idea.

**Next Meeting:**

* CIP Editors Meeting #63:
* **Postponed to April 4th 5:30 GMT**
* Held on Discord - [here](https://discord.gg/4yukWV3khD).
* Agenda TBC

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

One of this year’s primary objectives has been to help educate the community on the technical functionality required to run Catalyst. Part of that mission has been to increase transparency in the backend systems. Of course, with this comes the need to continue community collaboration, and we’re hoping to see members champion community co-creation as they help to build and suggest improvements to these systems.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

4/2/2023,"Hello everyone,

My question is, if it is possible to consolidate the balances of several Cardano/ADA addresses in a single address, or if there are any implications in this regard.

Honestly, I'm kind of ignorant of these things (I even tried to transfer my ADA to a single address, but it still charge fees for network usage, unlike an exchange, and yes, I've held off asking this question for quite some time, a bit embarrassing, but I still think other new users can learn from it).

Thank you very much for the clarifications.

PS: I have 3 addresses in my account, and the 3 have different balances, and I would like to have the balance in only one."
4/3/2023,I have a really powerful computer and this garbage of wallet takes forever to start taking up to 15% of CPU usage and close to 13GB of ram.. it also takes an eternity to sync the wallet or do anything that involves syncing not to mention its total size is like 100GB. It  also has problems pairing with cold wallets. One of my biggest regrets in crypto if not the single biggest regret was to had moved my ADA to Daedalus back in 2020. Now it is been a journey of patience and alot of pain just to access it. Do yourself a favor and stay very far away from this wallet unless you are some sort of masochist
4/2/2023,"This question comes up occasionally, especially from people arriving from other blockchains or moving their funds from an exchange to a self-custodial wallet. Here's something I posted to the Essential Cardano website on this subject:

[https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/is-my-ada-safe-when-staking](https://www.essentialcardano.io/faq/is-my-ada-safe-when-staking)

[Essential Cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/) is a great resource and can answer many of your questions."
4/2/2023,"Just to sum up.
In case you don’t have the time to read the article (it’s short though) but here goes.
Charles Hoskinson, creator of Cardano (ADA), believes that in the next 5-10 years, nation-states could use Cardano's technology to run their countries. 
This could include national identity systems, payment systems, or even central bank digital currencies. 
However, Hoskinson warns that there are powerful forces trying to stop the progress of cryptocurrencies and decentralization, and that it's important for individuals to have control over their money, identity, data, and economic agency while limiting government power."
4/2/2023,"Hi, will Cardano shard its layer 1?  Will mithril and input endorsers make transactions faster? And final question did the team launch pipelining and will it make transactions faster? I would be grateful if you can answer my questions I can't find good info about it and I want to learn"
4/1/2023,"Here is a stream where I demo the open-source wallet connector that we will be making available to anyone building games on Cardano utilising engines such as Godot, Unreal and Unity. We published the first operational demo of a Cardano game engine integration back in August 2021, and we've been actively involved in supporting gaming projects on Cardano ever since.

Our method removes the need for API calls for fixed / known assets held in light wallets. You can also connect multiple wallets at once. You can see in this demo how fast the connector works, also shown is the really awesome avatar customiser that pulls in data from over 12 policies in seconds.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
4/1/2023,"World Mobile is an exciting RealFi project building on Cardano. They are using cryptocurrency and incentives to be able to successfully decentralize telecommunications and provide mobile and internet service in the most remote and disconnected places. 

They are achieving significant progress with their network in Zanzibar, but are you aware of everything else they have developed and the things they have planned?

There was a lot done by world mobile and in this video, we dive deeper into the progress, but also into everything they have planned in their roadmap: [https://youtu.be/BILyk275-Ks](https://youtu.be/BILyk275-Ks) 

In addition, we will also dive deeper into the tokenomics of WMT which is the driving force of the ecosystem."
4/1/2023,"So….. as a functioning coin, what exactly makes Bitcoin better than Cardano?
Did Bitcoin get it right way back when or is it riding old coat tails?"
4/1/2023,"The most recent CIP-1694 update as graphically designed 'in a nut shell' by Hornan for Able Pool is linked here: 

[https://twitter.com/Hornan7/status/1636757527479169027/photo/1](https://twitter.com/Hornan7/status/1636757527479169027/photo/1)

&#x200B;

A list of constitutional committee members has been drafted based on community nominations for the purposes of such actions as graphically shown, as well as composing the first Cardano Constitution. Link:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHLsDptxCGURPyf9hSXvAwVtg9m-45g8VSS7l5g6d3E/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHLsDptxCGURPyf9hSXvAwVtg9m-45g8VSS7l5g6d3E/edit#)

What opinions do you have about this list and do you guys have nominations that you would like to add? 

&#x200B;

I believe that this list consists of people that brings value to creating the Cardano Constitution, and it should also include additional employees of Cardano that directly contributed to developing Cardano to what it is now."
3/31/2023,This morning I decided to withdraw my staking rewards after I thought the lastest rewards had been issued but it must have been during the staking epoch. Now the transaction seems to be stuck. It is showing my ADA withdrawal is submitted and is greyed out in the transaction. The dashboard shows a new reward total including the amount I tried to withdraw. This withdrawal was made in Yoroi in Brave browser. If I have a look at Yoroi in Chrome or Firefox the transaction is not shown. Will this correct it self in time or should I do a withrawal of the current total rewards in one of the other browsers?

16. Here’s an interesting theory: taking down Binance would create too big a hole, so they took down Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature to insulate the fiat world from crypto.

27. This is one of the craziest things I’ve seen in crypto. Balaji is burning a few million to ring the fire alarm and make everyone aware of what he believes is an impending attack on dollar holders. Counterparty is guaranteed $1million (minus BTC price) if he just buys one additional BTC (or an option to purchase more).

33. Here’s why they are opening the swap lines: so that US treasuries don’t get dumped on the open market by foreign banks. This way the foreign central banks can have dollars to absorb the treasuries from the foreign banks.

62. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
3/31/2023,"Hey everyone, looking for a tax site I can link my wallet for transaction history, doesn’t look like TaxBit has Cardano. Anyone else have luck finding a good one?"
3/30/2023,"Cardano is a Peer-to-Peer network. This means that anyone can run their own node, which is easy, cheap, and requires no third-party approval. Have you ever thought that a single entity could run multiple nodes? In theory, there's nothing to prevent it. The question is what someone could gain by doing so. If an attacker running many nodes under one identity could gain some competitive advantage over other nodes, this would be a so-called Sybil attack. Peer-to-Peer networks must be able to resist this attack. Cardano uses ADA coins to prevent Sybil attacks and maintains the security and integrity of the network.

# TLDR

Blockchain decentralization must be based on expensive resources and not on the ability to run a node or create a wallet (account). The number of nodes in the network is completely irrelevant to decentralization. There are thousands of pools and 1.3M stakers in the Cardano network. This is the decentralization of the Cardano network, but it is important to remember that an individual can have multiple staking wallets or run multiple pools. The ADA holder does not need to run a full node and can participate in the decentralization of the network through the wallet and get rewarded for it. On-chain governance should work very similarly to block production. DReps will have as much decision-making power as the stake they get from delegates. 

**Why must decentralization be based on an expensive resource?**

In general, a Sybil attack is a type of online security attack where a single entity creates multiple fake identities or accounts on a network or system to gain an unfair advantage or control over it. The goal of a Sybil attacker is to control a significant portion of the network, allowing them to influence decisions, manipulate data, or disrupt the network's functioning. In the context of blockchain, a Sybil attack can be implemented through the creation of multiple wallets or by running multiple nodes. It depends on what the attacker's goal is and what advantage he wants to gain.

When the 'health factor' of a loan is below 1, anyone can call the liquidate contract to repay part of the debt owed and receive discounted collateral in return.  Liqwid incentivizes SPOs and developers to participate in the health of the overall protocol, by acting in their own interest (to receive the discounted collateral) and as a result, ensure loans are sufficiently collateralized.

3/30/2023,"I have been a holder of ADA for a while now but since life has taken over a bit, I haven’t been able to keep track of any news in a little over a year, for really any of my holdings. I’m starting to do some research but curious how everyone else is seeing the chain. 

One of the projects I found was Iagon. I actually started to look into filecoin and storj but since I mainly hold ADA, I was looking for a storage project on cardano. My issue with it is that it’s catering to data centers and not home users. Are there any other decentralized storage projects upcoming? How about decentralized compute, similar to flux nodes? 

I also just saw that IOHK is releasing a new wallet. Is that something that Ada holders have to update to instead of Daedalus?  

My goal is just to keep up to date with crypto as a whole and more specifically Ada. I recently decided I was going to try my hand at creating my own stake pool, so I want to be able to keep up on everything, but I need to do my research of what has happened to really keep up to date.

Edit: just noticed that the IOHK wallet is a light browser wallet. Great for new comers and people who don’t want to wait a whole day to update Daedalus"

9. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python.

10. The NY Attorney General just filed against Kucoin for being an unregistered broker-dealer. Here’s the important part: they’re alleging that ETH is a security and a commodity.

12. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners.

13. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected.

15. Rep. Foster (Cryptophobe): “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto?

16. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).

17. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

3/29/2023,"After researching Lace I think the potential to facilitate mass adoption is there. 

Lace aims to be super easy to use, and the best part is that everything crypto-related that you might need can be found and used without ever leaving Lace. 

You can access a Dapp store, where you will have certified Dapps and Smart contracts for everything you need, you will have access to educational content, and even the possibility to participate in governance. 

Better than that it’s not just cardano, but Lace aims to be Multichain

3/29/2023,"Hi all,

Im currently holding 2000 tokens in Binance, but i would like to move them to Revolut.
So my question is - which is the most secure, legitimate way of doing it, because i’ve never done it before.

I’m also on a big loss there, because when i bought them, they were worth 1.5$ per token. So i guess i shouldn’t pay any taxes right?


Many thanks,
Artin"

3/29/2023,"Computers changed the world because we were able to write more efficient software. Computers have automated many tasks that were previously performed by humans, especially in areas such as accounting, science, and other fields that involve large amounts of data processing. In many industries, we didn't mind, and greater efficiency was seen as an advantage. Technology is now getting into areas where we are becoming more vigilant. Even though banks are using modern software and the internet, now is the time when technology can take the next step and replace other financial services processes. Could decentralized technologies be the next step that fundamentally changes the financial sector? And what role can Cardano play in this? 

# TLDR

Banks have never failed because of a software bug. It is time to reflect on whether decentralization can improve the functioning of banks. We can certainly write software better than we can put responsible and reliable people in key positions. So far, people have mostly failed us. Software can't do that and does exactly what it's programmed to do. It's time to trust the code more than the people. We will always need people to make risk assessments or investment recommendations. So we need to look for the right connection between people and a decentralized bank. Decentralization can solve some of the problems of banks and better protect depositors' assets. Smart contracts can form a key part of banking software and all assets will be on the blockchain.

9. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python. Unless you have full anonymity, you WILL be cross-chain bridged to IRL law. Some DAOs will learn this the hard way.

10. The NY Attorney General just filed against Kucoin for being an unregistered broker-dealer. Here’s the important part: they’re alleging that ETH is a security and a commodity. Their argument is not complex...it’s very straightforward. [https://www.docdroid.net/Myyp0yz/kucoin-pdf](https://www.docdroid.net/Myyp0yz/kucoin-pdf)
11. Silvergate was a failure of fractional reserve banking, not of crypto. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1633608132713938945](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1633608132713938945)
12. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners.

13. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke.

15. Rep. Foster (Cryptophobe): “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto?

16. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure). [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703)
17. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

19. Now we’re dealing with U.S. bank runs. Among the casualties was Silicon Valley Bank where Centre (the Circle/Coinbase joint entity that issues USDC) was keeping $3.3 billion of the $43ish billion backing USDC. Signature Bank was also shut down by regulators.

21. The Feds were taking bids for anyone to acquire SVB until 2pm Eastern on Sunday. The big question on Sunday was whether the Feds will cover all uninsured depositors.

43. Here’s an interesting theory: taking down Binance would create too big a hole, so they took down Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature to insulate the fiat world from crypto. Now they can take down Binance. [https://twitter.com/BryceWeiner/status/1636055979870818305](https://twitter.com/BryceWeiner/status/1636055979870818305)

54. This is one of the craziest things I’ve seen in crypto. Balaji is burning a few million to ring the fire alarm and make everyone aware of what he believes is an impending attack on dollar holders. Counterparty is guaranteed $1million (minus BTC price) if he just buys one additional BTC (or an option to purchase more).

60. Here’s why they are opening the swap lines: so that US treasuries don’t get dumped on the open market by foreign banks. This way the foreign central banks can have dollars to absorb the treasuries from the foreign banks.

74. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action.

89. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano.

3/28/2023,"Every decentralized and public blockchain network needs some means on which decentralization is based. For Cardano, it's ADA coins. This is a finite, non-renewable resource with a non-zero market value. For PoW networks like Bitcoin, the two resources are ASIC hardware and electricity. Both resources are renewable, infinite (can be produced over and over), and have a non-zero market value. Let's take a closer look at Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work and compare the advantages and disadvantages in the context of different attack vectors.

# TLDR

The 51% attack is very costly for Cardano and Bitcoin and probably difficult to commit in practice. However, it is not the only attack vector against which the blockchain must be resilient. Protection against many attacks is based on decentralization. PoW miners fight among themselves and drive each other out of business. This leads to more centralization and therefore weakened security, especially against internal attacks (censorship resistance). ADA holders are working together to decentralize and secure Cardano not only when it comes to the production of blocks but in near future also within governance. Dysfunctional governance can also be one of the attack vectors.

thank you!"
3/28/2023,"Hey all! New to this subreddit, but been a long-time Cardano fan recently getting back into the space. I have been searching for new projects, and as a climate-change activity myself wanted to give an objective take on a project I came across recently that aligns with my interests and I'm eager to hear everyone's thoughts on the project. Note that most of the information here is from their whitepaper which was released rather recently.

eTukTuk is a project that aims to revolutionize the transportation sector in developing countries and beyond by building an affordable network of charging stations and proprietary electric vehicles. The project seeks to tackle air pollution, CO2-related health conditions, and financial exclusion, which are major challenges in developing nations across the globe.

The eTukTuk ecosystem has been developed over the last five years, and it is expected to have a direct impact on reducing air pollution, CO2-related health conditions, and financial exclusion in developing countries. The project offers a sustainable and scalable solution to the 270 million internal combustion engine (ICE) TukTuks and other two- and three-wheeler vehicles that are having a detrimental impact on developing economies.

The project aims to create a culture of innovation, act with integrity, and empower the masses. eTukTuk envisions a future where anyone can be involved in tackling air pollution, CO2-related health conditions, and financial exclusion. The project has the potential to revolutionize the transportation sector in developing economies and beyond.

eTukTuk will be built on Cardano, a third-generation blockchain platform that offers advanced functionality and security features. The use of blockchain technology allows eTukTuk to address some of the pressing issues faced by developing countries, such as financial exclusion, transparency, and accountability.

The project will use smart contracts to ensure the efficient and secure operation of the network. It will also leverage the Cardano blockchain's banking capabilities to bank the unbanked and reduce the cost of financial transactions. Additionally, eTukTuk will use a side-chain to separate the network's operational functionalities from the Cardano ecosystem's main blockchain, providing more flexibility and scalability.

The eTukTuk project also features a unique token economics model that is designed to incentivize network participants to act in the best interest of the ecosystem. The token will be used to reward participants for contributing to the network's growth and overall sustainability.

Overall, eTukTuk represents an exciting opportunity to address some of the significant challenges faced by developing countries. The project's focus on sustainability, scalability, and inclusivity, coupled with its use of advanced blockchain technology, makes it a compelling project to watch in the Cardano ecosystem.

Would love to hear anyone's thoughts. My biggest concerns relate the the price barriers for carrying out such an initiative, but other than that it's great to see more sustainability projects coming into the space."

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
3/27/2023,"Total Value Locked (TVL) makes a new ATH regularly. That's definitely a good thing for DeFi, but it's not the only important indicator we should be concerned about. More important is the activity on the network and the number of users. Cardano is growing in these stats as well. In this article, we will focus on the number of non-zero balance accounts.

# TLDR

The Shelley and Alonzo hard forks were significant milestones for Cardano. Account growth increased 12-fold in 2 years based on these events. The number of new accounts continues to grow in the current bear market. Cardano is slowly getting into a similar situation as Ethereum in 2017 when the number of accounts grew 4-fold. Cardano has a chance to reach the 10M account mark with non-zero balances in 2025. If that happens, Cardano will be almost unstoppable.

# From hundreds of thousands of users to millions in 2 years

The path to a high network effect always starts with a small number of users. Blockchain protocols are much like social networks. Their use is completely voluntary and is mainly determined by user preferences and the network effect already obtained. All newer projects have the slight disadvantage of catching up with existing ones. The blockchain industry is still very young and major waves of adoption are still ahead. It is still realistic to catch up with existing rivals in user numbers. All current dominant blockchain projects started with literal units of users. Within a few years, they have reached millions of users. This is true for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and, as you will soon see, at the moment also for Cardano. 

There was a Shelley hard fork in July 2020 which opened staking for ADA holders. Alonzo hard fork brought smart contracts to Cardano in September 2021. These were two key events in terms of adoption that kick-started the growth in accounts.

3/27/2023,"Some things coming to Cardano in the rest of 2023:

* [USDA](https://www.anzens.com/) fiat-backed stable coin by Emurgo. This nicely complements Djed and iUSD.
* [Ouroboros Genesis](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/02/09/ouroboros-genesis-enhanced-security-in-a-dynamic-environment/), making Cardano the only PoS network which can bootstrap from Genesis without trusted checkpoints.
* Improved developer experience thanks to [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) smart contract platform. Interesting alternatives include Eopsin, Helios, Plutarch, Plu-ts, Scalus. Developers can step away from Plutus Tx. Smart contract development gets easier and smart contracts become much smaller.
* [Mithril](https://docs.cardano.org/development-guidelines/scalability-solutions/mithril), allowing quick syncing of the blockchain so that light wallets can sync in a trustless way.
* [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/), a L2 solution using isomorphic state channels. Caveat: This is NOT an easy fix that can simply scale all Cardano dapps, it remains to be seen what parts of Cardano can actually be scaled by Hydra. This currently is a bit complicated. Sundaeswap is experimenting with Hydra, but Axo devs do not think Hydra is good for scaling DEXs...
* [Lace wallet](https://www.lace.io/), an open source wallet by IOG.
* Launch of the EVM side chain by IOG. I'm not really excited about the EVM side chain itself, but the side chain toolkit in general is interesting and I think this side chain can act as an example for other side chains.
* Launch of many interesting dapps like [Axo Trade](https://www.axo.trade/) (first DEX to really leverage eUTXO model), [Meld](https://www.meld.com/), [Genius Yield](https://www.geniusyield.co/), [Spectrum Finance](https://spectrum.fi/) (first open source truly decentralized DEX), [Aneta BTC](https://anetabtc.io/) (trustless wrapped BTC), [TeddySwap](https://teddyswap.org/). Also further developments on [Liqwid](https://www.liqwid.finance/) pooled lending and launch of [Aada Finance V2](https://aada.finance/) with pooled lending.
* Launch of digital identies (DIDs) [Atala Prism](https://atalaprism.io/) and [IAMX](https://iamx.id/). 
* Integration of oracle solutions [Charli3](https://charli3.io/?__cf_chl_tk=L2Ej.4xr8wyhALGkQhx81de13QlbepNCFZyPFuQ27WI-1679917352-0-gaNycGzNCyU) and [Orcfax](https://orcfax.io/). 

Edit: Some developments that I expect in 2024:  


* [Ouroboros Leios](https://twitter.com/_KtorZ_/status/1596108547942670338) (a.k.a. Input Endorsers). This feature will greatly improve the throughput of Cardano's L1. 
* [Midnight](https://midnight.iohk.io/) side chain. A privacy side chain by IOG which allows users to control their data, with private smart contracts written in Typescript. "
3/27/2023,"I’m trying to understand some of basic functionality differences between Atala Prism and Solid. 

I get Prism is “built of the block chain” but how specifically? Is the data stored in Atala servers or somehow directly in the block chain? Or is Prism just using security certificates/ identifiers that are stored as transactions in the block chain and verifiable. Then the associated data of each account is on their servers? Which is still hackable… 

If the raw data is stored on Atala servers then why not use Prism instead? Prism allows you to self host if I’m not mistaken? (Obviously still hackable)

Is it that are they two different functions but similar uses for data?

Example: Atala allows for trust less verification say for “X”, an engineering degree. It shows proof that it was attained, issued from a university and you as end user has full control who sees/know this?

While solid allows end users to hold and control their personal data and certificates locally? Yet without any sort of confirmation and validity? 

Any help here would be greatly appreciated. 

I still feel like I’m missing something here…(or maybe a lot)

3/27/2023,"I've seen all this talk about ""if you stake ADA, and then add more ADA to that wallet, the added amount becomes automatically staked"".

However, what's not clear to me is, **which address** should I send the additional ADA to? Does it matter? Since Cardano is UTXO, I'm getting a different ADA address every time. Does it matter if it's an old address or a new address? Can I send to a brand new address on the same wallet and still have it added to my stake?

Also, how soon are the rewards paid out **on the portion that is newly staked**? For example, if I have 100 ADA staked now and choose to add another 500 ADA later, will the 500 amount be subject to waiting three epochs before rewards are earned from it?"

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

After doing my due diligence, I got really excited about World Mobile, because of the amazing technology and incentives they have developed, all of the progress, and the great team pushing this project!

If you want to dive deeper into this project check out this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuVgbuUrNvs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuVgbuUrNvs) 

There is definitely a huge need for decentralized mobile networks as it will allow to connect half of the world that currently is either disconnected or does not have a reliable mobile connection, and some of the progress they have done so far has been impressive."

Wondering what people who have put their ADA in so far have experienced.

What could be improved?"

The program has my current balance off by 10,000 ADA and it's impossible to find the error because every small transactions ends up as 10 by the way the program breaks it down. I was hoping that looking at my balance history in my Nami wallet would help me reconcile where I went wrong.

I know I can see the transactions in a scanner, but I'm looking for a simple way to see my balance at any snapshot in time."

 I've downloaded eternl wallet, will I be able to see everything I own in eternl and also is there a way to view my wallet contents without inputting with my seed phrase.

# Hello there, beautiful soul!

Hope this message finds you well.  


This past week, some of the world has changed their clocks to summer timezone. This is a kind reminder that town halls continue airing at 5PM UTC. This means that in some parts you may need to manually adjust your calendar. Another set of time changes is expected to take place this weekend already. Keep an eye on this not to miss the latest broadcast.  


Despite the time change bonanza, last week we had a great presentation and brief discussion around legal frameworks when it comes to blockchain. DLT360 team presented their impressive close out series on their funded proposal. You can check out [their timestamped segment here](https://www.youtube.com/live/TtTepcCxAzw?feature=share&t=564). Great insights. We also had three other community project presentations in form of [Neural IDs/NFTs](https://www.youtube.com/live/TtTepcCxAzw?feature=share&t=1326), [Meta DID experiment](https://www.youtube.com/live/TtTepcCxAzw?feature=share&t=2052), and [Haskell Course for Developers](https://www.youtube.com/live/TtTepcCxAzw?feature=share&t=2407). Congratulations on completing your projects.  


If you have a project that you are about to close out and wish to share with the community, reach out to me and let's schedule your presentation for one of the upcoming town halls. Let's tell the world the amazing things you're up to!  


This week, [WADA presents their impressions](https://www.youtube.com/live/lkTZkf7tKxI?feature=share&t=614) from winning the film festival, [Community Advisor challenge team shares their insights](https://www.youtube.com/live/lkTZkf7tKxI?feature=share&t=1658), and [the Catalyst team presents the first insight](https://www.youtube.com/live/lkTZkf7tKxI?feature=share&t=2510) into proposed direction for Fund10 adjustments. Starting with assessments stage. Make sure to catch the details further down.   


For now - what's the latest? Dive in.

Governance conversations continue. Have you had a chance to participate yet? There are some opportunities for you.  


Great ways to dive into conversation is reading up [www.1694.io](http://www.1694.io/) portal or catch the latest with the community initiative Voltaire News! yet? Check out [this timestamped segment](https://www.youtube.com/live/FpZf99M1i4M?feature=share&t=3078) from the last town hall to learn more. But in a nutshell: [a new collaborative community newsletter](http://bit.ly/voltaire-news) started by Governance Guild to help the community keep track of the CIP-1694 debate.  


Additionally, following on from the earlier [CIP-1694 workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWm0S_H_Qyw) in Colorado, the organizing team would like to invite all community members to a conversation on the [30th March via Zoom](https://www.addevent.com/event/TZ16421227). It will be an opportunity to recap the [workshop](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-1694-...) with attendees, hear more about CIP-1694, as well as discuss future workshops and the next steps along the path to the Age of Voltaire.  


If you wish to add your perspectives to CIP 1694, make sure to share them [here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380). Add your voice as the era of Voltaire rolls out!

# Project Catalyst is looking ahead

https://preview.redd.it/72ws3jg6fqpa1.png?width=1952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ed9903d4240efd32cbede8899ef5a5badf06c707

There are number of proposed changes for Fund10 that are going to be gradually shared over the weeks to come. This week, we began with looking at what an alternative path looks like for the assessments stage in Cardano's Project Catalyst.   


Catalyst funding rounds have been on pause for a little while now. Thank you everyone for your patience and continued support as we've navigated these past months. 2023 is shaping up to be an important year for Cardano, and equally so for Catalyst.

Since F9’s end, the Catalyst team’s been deep in research, discovery and design mode. Holding many workshops with the community, a lot of 1:1s, and received additional user-centered feedback from fund surveys, social media & more. All that stock has been carefully considered and time's come to share the findings and a suggested proposal for the next steps. Starting with the assessment stage.

You can catch [the main town hall segment timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/live/lkTZkf7tKxI?feature=share&t=2510) or you can also [breeze through this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/danny_cryptofay/status/1638900080898891777). Your input would be very valuable. The after town hall recording will also be made available shortly on [Catalyst Swarm Youtube list.](https://bit.ly/33i38SB)

# Bounties? Yes, please. 

https://preview.redd.it/a3jx6lm7fqpa1.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=03ba3525f19c0fe202558f342c8c0c42e2363f00

Did you know that Catalyst Swarm is pioneering and experimenting with bounties in the ecosystem? There are a variety of different bounties found on the swarm Dework bounty board \[regularly updated - new tasks continuously added\], in which you can partake in and earn some rewards (ADA, Gimbal tokens or AGIX). Check out [the bounty board via this link.](https://app.dework.xyz/catalyst-swarm/catalyst-swarm-bount)

# Funded Project Workshops 

https://preview.redd.it/vn9nqex8fqpa1.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=446686953a9914abf7cddaf3b457637f9cb67d19

Catalyst has recently reached 450+ completed projects, an amazing milestone but the next question is ‘wen 500?’  


To continue to support funded projects, the Catalyst team is committed to facilitating business growth and technical workshops. The aim is to create as much education and resources as possible to support the growth, development, and success of projects building in the Catalyst ecosystem.  


We want to increase the cadence of these sessions and keep the community connected with the process. So we are opening up speaker/guest slots for business and technical leaders within the community to sign up and deliver presentations at the workshop sessions, taking place on the bi-weekly coordinator meetings.  


To help facilitate, you can sign up via this form: [https://bit.ly/42ffVyL](https://bit.ly/42ffVyL)

# New Funded Project Guidelines 

https://preview.redd.it/uoca8xcafqpa1.png?width=1790&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0258ebf4182631d225b5ab70b8ef59e98e4712d5

The Catalyst team has been collecting feedback from funded projects via various workshops and retrospectives on iterations for post funded process flow. As the complexity and volume of requests grows each fund, several processes have been introduced as a proposal to help address some of the growing challenges.  


We would love your feedback [by leaving a comment on this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JG1lJhUUZshocMJsLxJbslxiLR2B_af9hBSA68w3xJ4/edit). The goal is to consider any additional comments and feedback before rolling out the new guidelines to be in effect from April 1st.  


Thank you in advance for your kind time and efforts.

# Last week in CIPs

https://preview.redd.it/7sd4i1rbfqpa1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=907cbbe566dfcc68b92dc7279b03a17124aa4885

Here's the recap from my colleague [Ryan Williams](https://twitter.com/Ryun1_) that writes these fantastic CIP round-ups. I figured you'd like them, too. So here's the latest to get up to speed. You can catch past and future summaries [via this Cardano forum thread here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/what-happened-in-cips-last-week/109101) as well. If are unsure what CIPs are about - please check out this link to dive deeper: [https://cips.cardano.org/](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). 

**RW:** What happened in CIPs last week?

* [CIP-???? | Supercharged Native Scripts](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/479) **\[New Proposal\]**:
   * This CIP proposes replacing the current native scripts used for minting Cardano Native Tokens with simple smart contracts.
* [CPS-???? | Voltaire era Governance](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/481) **\[New Problem\]**:
   * This CPS tried to frame a set of motivations, goals, constraints, and open questions for the very broad topic of Cardano governance.
   * This is to accompany CIP-1694 to allow for discussion of the problem of governance rather than the technical solution.

**RW:** CIP Editors Meeting #62 -- my notes:

* [CIP-0084? | Ledger evolution (meta)](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/456):
   * Looking good to merge -- due to the nature of the proposal it does not need much engagement past the Ledger team.
   * With post meeting clarification on RSS CIPs application to the Ledger category, this is in Last Check for the next meeting.
* [CIP-0030 | Upgrade to latest format & propose version / extension scheme](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/446):
   * With small amendments to remove positional arguments, this can be merged as it has a lot of positive discussion.
* [CIP-0090? | Extendable dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/462):
   * Author (me) present to discuss.
   * Overall needs more discussion from wallet providers.
   * Number can be assigned.
* [CIP-0091? | Don't force Built-In functions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/459):
   * Lots of good discussion with author engaging very well.
   * Assign a number and look to merge in the next meeting.
* [CIP-0092? | First-class errors in Plutus](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/469):
   * Author present and provided great explanation.
   * Benchmarks/analysis on how much more efficient this is would be nice.
* [CIP-0089? | Beacon Tokens & Distributed Dapps](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/466):
   * Seems to be some off-github discussions around this proposal - would be good to link them.
   * Can assign a number.
   * Somewhat informal, might benefit from a CPS.
* [CIP-0088?: Native Asset Policy Registration/Information Certificates](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/467):
   * Can assign a number.
   * Author has had some good engagement.
   * More comments and discussion around related CIPs and CPSs should be added.
* [CPS-???? | Reading metadata in Plutus contracts](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/474):
   * More detail is needed.
   * This is more of a feature request than a problem statement. Furthermore this is a feature which had purposely not included by the Plutus team.
   * So this is rejected for now.
* [CIP-0030 | Add chain id to differentiate between testnets](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/323):
   * Has good support.
   * This should fit as an extension to CIP-30 as discussed in [#466](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/446), although it is unclear if the author wants to pursue.
* [CIP-0077? | Verified Stake Pool Identity](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/361):
   * Could benefit from more discussion by SPOs.
   * Good and timely proposal.

**Next Meeting:**

* CIP Editors Meeting #63:
   * March 28th 5pm UTC.
* Held on Discord - [here](https://discord.gg/4yukWV3khD).
* Agenda TBC

Further varied governance and Catalyst community conversations can be also followed on [the official Cardano forum here](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). Don't be shy to be part of the conversation.

# Gimbalabs presents: Plutus Project-Based Learning

https://preview.redd.it/uk3kxgqmfqpa1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc910c96027e9f686ee81938a935d3b51cfc75d0

This week, [Gimbalabs](https://twitter.com/gimbalabs) launched the new version of their Plutus Project-Based Learning program. The two previous versions led them to this fantastic version: [https://plutuspbl.io  ](https://plutuspbl.io/)

No doubt, PPBL v3 is the answer to the question: Where do I start as a Cardano developer, now? 

👩‍🏭now = no money, no pre-requirements, no gatekeepers.👨‍🏭

Note 1: Great news: Gimbalabs Plutus PBL is in the process of being translated into several languages, including: Indonesian, French, Vietnamese, Japanese, Spanish. Soon it will be in your own language.

This program is open source, which makes it adaptable to the needs of different organizations. If you🫵 want to train your employees, your students, your community, your team members, your family and friends: the time is now 🫵 (the now from above, remember?). Need help: leave them a message on twitter:  [@gimbalabs](https://twitter.com/gimbalabs)

Don't forget to register to take part in a Catalyst Special Voting Event (SVE) if you haven't already. If you have cast a vote in the past you just need to ensure you still have a valid QR and PIN code available. Here's [the guide](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005679386-Catalyst-registration-and-voting-guide). Not sure what SVE is just yet? The Catalyst team also shared a quick update during this month's Cardano 360 show and you can catch [the timestamped segment here](https://youtu.be/J2UdDtqziF4?t=385). More information is coming soon.

Did you ever wonder how Cardano Treasury functions? And its origins? Markus has written a fantastic tweet thread that dives into this topic. Markus has been a long time community member and stake pool operator since the early days of Cardano. Definitely worth a read.

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

https://preview.redd.it/2r0zajjufqpa1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=81ee808c3ed05915189065d6353e8c28ffaf0188

One of this year’s primary objectives is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems. The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.

3/25/2023,"Are there any issues if I use NAMI but now want to use eternl to view a wallet? 

I understand NAMI uses one address and going from Eternl to NAMI could cause assets to not display but NAMI to eternl?

Want to be able to use my dex's on my phone.  I love the simplicity of NAMI but eternl has mobile and so much more functionality."
3/24/2023,"I used Daedalus. Now i'm using [Pool.pm](https://Pool.pm) for staking. I was wondering how to I claim UTXOs? I have 8 in total (I don't spend my ada just delegate to pools. I have 2 between 1-10 ada 5 between 100-1000 ada, and 1 between 1k-10k ada. 

How do I get claim / do something with this? 

Also I was trying to claim my genius x rewards for staking (Been staking over 3k in ada for 2-3 years now. Just switch pools recently, Staked with PAUL1 for years then went to GEN1 for not even a week now I'm with DAPP Central. Been staking almost 4000 ada with him going on 2 weeks or so. 

When I put my staking address (Rewards address) Genius X tells me undetermined. Ive been staking via ledger for years. I was thinking its because I just switched pools. I would really like some rewards air drops because I seem to always miss them. Never received any kind of drops before. 

&#x200B;

Anyways thanks in advanced for the help."

6. Here’s the wilder, more extreme take from Balaji. Interestingly, he and Caitlin disagree about how many big prints are left and they both say the position of the other could be right. [https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN\_lCI](https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN_lCI)

8. There’s a new test version of Lace out there with a dApp connector and hardware wallet capabilities. You can give it a try on testnet! [https://twitter.com/lace\_io/status/1632796455038492673](https://twitter.com/lace_io/status/1632796455038492673)

15. Wow! Utah just passed a bill instituting Limited Liability Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (LLDs). You have to identify one human organizer. You can elect to be taxed as a corp or LLC (pass through taxation). Some will like it. Some won’t. But, the mainstream reach of crypto is undeniably growing. [https://le.utah.gov/\~2023/bills/static/HB0357.html](https://le.utah.gov/~2023/bills/static/HB0357.html)
16. Sen. Lummis killed it in a recent hearing defending the energy use in crypto. It’s less relevant for us in Cardano since we’re not PoW. But, still entertaining to watch. [https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1633214192437084161](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1633214192437084161)

25. Paul Krugman hilariously complains about being locked out of his Venmo account. He predicted the impact of the internet would be about as much as the fax machine and has subsequently opposed crypto. [https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1633472068355346437](https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1633472068355346437) [https://twitter.com/mdudas/status/1633571193344126979](https://twitter.com/mdudas/status/1633571193344126979)

31. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python. Unless you have full anonymity, you WILL be cross-chain bridged to IRL law. Some DAOs will learn this the hard way. [https://twitter.com/lex\_node/status/1633925979004436481](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1633925979004436481)
32. The NY Attorney General just filed against Kucoin for being an unregistered broker-dealer. Here’s the important part: they’re alleging that ETH is a security and a commodity.

33. Silvergate was a failure of fractional reserve banking, not of crypto. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1633608132713938945](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1633608132713938945)
34. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners. [https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget\_fy2023.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf)
35. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUUy4\_KwNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUUy4_KwNU)
36. Rep. Emmer (Pro-Crypto) called the current regulatory approach “lazy & destructive…that is chilling innovation.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5670](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5670)
37. Rep. Foster (Cryptophobe): “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto? [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5266](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5266)
38. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure). [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703)
39. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

41. Now we’re dealing with U.S. bank runs. Among the casualties was Silicon Valley Bank where Centre (the Circle/Coinbase joint entity that issues USDC) was keeping $3.3 billion of the $43ish billion backing USDC. Signature Bank was also shut down by regulators. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/11/43-billion-nightmare-sudden-circle-depeg-could-be-about-to-crash-the-price-of-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/11/43-billion-nightmare-sudden-circle-depeg-could-be-about-to-crash-the-price-of-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana)

43. The Feds were taking bids for anyone to acquire SVB until 2pm Eastern on Sunday. The big question on Sunday was whether the Feds will cover all uninsured depositors. They decided they will and that also applies to Signature Bank.

45. Yellen said NO to a bailout for SVB on Sunday. She’s obviously got bigger macro concerns. But, it’s funny how that fits perfectly with a strategy of suppressing stablecoins generally.

51. Many in the crypto space think that Signature’s shutdown was just an extension of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 aimed at shuttering crypto banking. [https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter/status/1635328056234766337](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1635328056234766337)

56. GPT4 was released today. It crushes the Bar Exam, the SAT, the GRE, the LSAT, and almost all AP subjects. This will displace a lot of human jobs. [https://openai.com/research/gpt-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4)
57. It has already done amazing real world things. In Example #6 it shows you how to exploit an arbitrary ETH contract. Better pay attention crypto. [https://twitter.com/LinusEkenstam/status/1635754587775967233](https://twitter.com/LinusEkenstam/status/1635754587775967233)

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
3/23/2023,"## Cardano Roadmap: A Unique Approach to Blockchain Development

**Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform that was created with the goal of solving some of the key challenges facing the industry today.** To achieve this, the **Cardano team developed a roadmap consisting of five phases** that would guide the evolution of the platform over time. Each of the five eras in the Cardano roadmap is named after a person who made significant contributions to their respective fields. Such as literature, poetry or mathematics.

**One of the unique aspects of Cardano's development is its commitment to scientific rigor.** The **Cardano team is led by Charles Hoskinson**, a co-founder of Ethereum and a mathematician by training. **Hoskinson has assembled a team of academics and researchers to work on the platform**, and the team regularly publishes peer-reviewed research on topics such as consensus mechanisms and smart contract programming languages. **This scientific approach to development sets Cardano apart from other blockchain platforms** and has helped to establish it as a leader in the industry.

https://preview.redd.it/ehf7k20fvjpa1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e20cacade64e609b948b988c433bb6e480435af

##### These five phases are:

1. **Byron:** The first phase of the **Cardano roadmap focused on establishing the core infrastructure of the platform.** During this phase, the team worked to create a solid foundation for the platform, including the development of a robust consensus mechanism called Ouroboros.
2. **Shelley:** The second phase of the roadmap, **Shelley, was focused on decentralization.** This phase **introduced staking and delegation, allowing Cardano holders to participate in the consensus process and earn rewards** for helping to secure the network. Shelley also saw the launch of the Cardano mainnet, marking a major milestone in the platform's development.
3. **Goguen:** The third phase of the Cardano roadmap is Goguen, which is **focused on smart contract functionality. This phase will introduce the Plutus programming language**, which is designed to make it easier for developers to build and deploy smart contracts on the Cardano platform. Additionally, Goguen will introduce Marlowe, a domain-specific language that will enable the creation of financial contracts.
4. **Basho:** The fourth phase of the Cardano roadmap is **Basho, which is focused on scalability. This phase will introduce sharding and sidechains, which will allow the Cardano network to process a greater number of transactions per second.** Basho will also see the introduction of new consensus algorithms, including Proof of Stake Sidechains (POSS).
5. **Voltaire:** The final phase of the Cardano roadmap is **Voltaire, which is focused on governance and sustainability. This phase will introduce a treasury system that will fund the ongoing development and maintenance of the platform.** Additionally, Voltaire will introduce a voting system that will enable Cardano stakeholders to participate in the decision-making process for the platform.

Check out Cardano whiteboard overview with Charles Hoskinson explaining the roadmap phases on YouTube. 

**What sets Cardano apart from other blockchain platforms is its unique approach to development. The platform is built on three core principles: scalability, sustainability, and interoperability.** Cardano's focus on scalability is evident in its implementation of sharding and sidechains in the Basho phase, as well as its efficient consensus mechanism, Ouroboros. **The platform's focus on sustainability is achieved through its treasury system, which funds ongoing development and maintenance.** Finally, **Cardano's focus on interoperability is achieved through the use of multiple programming languages and a modular architecture that allows for customization.**

In conclusion, the **Cardano roadmap is a clear and deliberate plan for the evolution of the platform over time.** By focusing on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability, the Cardano team has created a platform that is well-suited for a wide range of use cases and has the potential to drive significant innovation in the years to come. As the platform continues to evolve through its five phases, we can expect to see even more exciting developments from the Cardano team. **As of March 2023, Cardano is currently progressing in the Voltaire phase of its roadmap with several latest updates.**"

3/23/2023,Does anyone know how to unstake my ADA on Coinbase? I know they recently changed their staking rules and whatnot and now I can’t seem to find an option anywhere for unstaking it?
3/23/2023,"Most stakers understand the basic principles of Proof-of-Stake and know that every epoch (5 days) they will receive rewards from the protocol if the pool to which the ADA coins are delegated has minted at least one block. There is confusion about how rewards are distributed by the Cardano protocol. In this article, we will explain this.

**TLDR**

* Rewards for staking are accumulated in a reward account that uses a balance rather than a UTXO-style accounting model.
* The reward balance increases every epoch and ADAs are automatically delegated to the pool. 
* Reward balance does not count as voting power in Catalyst. In order for ADA to be counted, a withdrawal is required through an on-chain transaction. 
* The current system does not require regular actions from stakers and saves resources.

3/23/2023,"Cardano metaverses are connected virtual worlds rendered in 3D real experiences on the Cardano blockchain.
The range of activities in these metaverses ranges from social interaction to e-commerce, education, gaming, fashion, and other transactions, along with experiences available in the real world.

Ordinary activities such as interactions through games, education, and other competitive activities are rewarded with NFTs, which are programmed assets using the Cardano blockchain.

What Is Cardano Metaverse?

The catalyst project on Cardano has funded several projects to increase the Cardano blockchain adoption.

With it, new metaverses have found their way into the Cardano ecosystem. Building a metaverse follows about the same process as building on other blockchains. There are four important steps to building a metaverse on the Cardano blockchain."

38. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there.

39. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

3/22/2023,"The traditional financial world is in trouble as banks in the US and Europe have begun to fail. Governments and central banks are implementing measures that will have an impact on rising inflation. This is not the first time we have seen a similar scenario. Similar events have been repeated over and over again. Bitcoin was created in response to the 2008 crisis. A decade later, we have other blockchain projects like Cardano, which can replace the banking system in another 5 to 10 years. They say that cryptocurrencies are to blame for the current financial problems. How is that possible? It must be said emphatically that the current problems have other reasons. They are the fractional reserve system, endless money printing, bailing out failing banks, poor risk management, corruption, and other things. The blockchain industry is the solution to many of the current problems of banks.

**TLDR**

* Bankers benefit from the fractional reserve system, but depositors bear the risks.
* Bearing the risk should mean accepting the loss if expectations are not met. If we do not keep this rule, it will lead to a loss of trust in the system.
* The ""fix the money, fix the world"" narrative is partly false. Fixing the financial system requires changing the rules.
* Cardano will allow us to create money with stable purchasing power backed by digital assets.
* Cardano will allow us to create a bank whose services will always be 100% backed by its own capital. The bank would be transparent and profits would be shared fairly with depositors.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

In addition, I also dive deeper into other important aspects of the project such as tokenomics, governance, and the Meld Foundation.

3/22/2023,"Nami is the only wallet that does not allow you to view your seed phase. Metamask , Phantom , Pera Algo , Etc allows the user to view seed phases when inside the wallet but why doesn't Nami do this?

Before i reformatted my PC, i wrote all possible phases down. I was confused about nami wallet since i looked at every possible option on viewing and double checking my seed phases. Noticed Nami doesn't have that option so i thought my username/PW was enough. Proceeded with the reset and now down 4k in ADA + nfts. Hope people can learn from this."

I have been staking Ada using a software wallet for a while now. If i move to a hardware wallet, do i need to unstake and resetup staking from the new wallet? Or can i just leave the ada staked and move the coins?

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
3/21/2023,"Right now epochs are ending with 37% utilization.

What happens in a few years when there are more layer 1 transactions than the epoch can process?"
3/22/2023,I use Yoroi wallet. Every once in a while I’ll check my rewards and it’s cut in half. I understand it varies but does anyone else have a similar experience?
3/21/2023,"Cardano uses ADA coins to reward pool operators and stakers, but also to fund Catalyst projects. In the future, coins from the project treasury will be used to reward DReps and the team that maintains the source code and implements protocol changes. Where does Cardano get these coins? Let's study the project's monetary policy and reward mechanism. 

# TLDR

* Unlike Bitcoin, Cardano has a project treasury so that development and governance can remain independent of VC funding.
* From the total epoch reward, 20% of the ADA coins will be moved to the project treasury and the rest will be used for staking rewards.
* Part of the incentive mechanism is to promote decentralization. If the protocol requirements for pools are not met, a portion of the staking reward is returned to the reserve.
* Cardano may find itself in a situation where the block production group is fighting for resources with the governance group.
* ADA coins are being used up from the reserve at a slower rate than originally anticipated.
* Decentralization is dependent on the project treasury.

# Monetary policy of the Cardano protocol

Cardano is being built to be independent of external funding in the future, especially from VC funds. The IOG team has been working on the development of the protocol and will hand it over to the community in the Voltaire era. Cardano needs to have enough ADA coins not only for block production rewards but also for the on-chain government. Delegation Representatives (DReps) will also receive rewards. In addition to the reserve, which every blockchain has in some form and contains coins for future rewards for those who participate in the production of blocks, Cardano has a project treasury. ADA coins from the project treasury will be used to fund governance (Voltaire), protocol development, and ecosystem development (Catalyst).

3/21/2023,"Hello Community, I am one of the Co-Founders of Xerberus, and I wanted to introduce our project and our live app and invite you to try the software out. 

**TLDR:** We are like Nansen.ai, grown out of the Cardano Ecosystem and building the best wallet labeling engine to make Crypto safer for all of us <3 

**Why are we building Xerberus?**

Crypto has a transparency issue. Most of us have invested money into a project only to realize shortly afterward that most of the claims made by the project were not true. Often, these situations combine average business risk, moral hazard, and malicious behavior. Cardano is no exception; we all have one or the other project name we think of when reading this paragraph. 

**Where is the software right now?** 

Xerberus helps you to understand more about projects with a few clicks. For example, you can use Xerberus to check if the wallets holding the token resemble advertised tokenomics (Spoiler: Most of the time, they don't). You also explore all major wallets holding a token and see if they are individuals, DEXs, or project-related wallets such as treasury or distribution. 

**What will come next?** 

The platform we are building is still in its infancy, but the basics are standing. We plan many more features to come soon; the most central element is our wallet labeling engine. This engine will automatically label all wallets within an ecosystem, making it ridiculously easy to spot subscription behavior like wash-trading or team members breaking their vesting schedule. 

**More Info:**

Intrigued? Watch this interview if you want to us the Co-Founders: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ-rMIKPEug&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ-rMIKPEug&feature=youtu.be)

Join our discord to ask more questions: [https://discord.gg/YQjWAPZffh](https://discord.gg/YQjWAPZffh)

31. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python.

35. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke.

38. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).

39. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

41. Now we’re dealing with U.S. bank runs. Among the casualties was Silicon Valley Bank where Centre (the Circle/Coinbase joint entity that issues USDC) was keeping $3.3 billion of the $43ish billion backing USDC.

Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
3/21/2023,Is there any wrapped or synthetic ADA in cardano’s chain?  Looking for a pool that has the ADA with the wrapped or synthetic version paired against it.  Which project has this?
3/20/2023,"Many people think that the decentralization of blockchains is based only on block production. Underneath the Proof-of-Stake (or another consensus) layer is the peer-to-peer network (or gossip network) that is used to connect the nodes. This is a physical infrastructure that you can think of as nodes connected by a network cable. Above these layers, there is the governance layer that is used for project management. Decentralization could not be achieved without the existence of a distributed network. Security depends on both of these layers. It is important to consider security and decentralization comprehensively and include all three layers. An attack on the blockchain can target any layer. If the network layer is successfully attacked, the consensus layer may also be compromised. With the new Cardano node version 1.35.6, network participants can start using automated dynamically updated P2P configuration without a need for manual maintenance. The Cardano network layer is becoming more secure and performant.

# TLDR

* With the older version of the Cardano node, SPOs had to manually maintain an unnecessarily large number of connections to peers. 
* Dynamic P2P enables an automated process that through self-discovery and optimization finds the most suitable peers.
* The network is more resistant to DoS attacks. 
* The Cardano node will automatically reconfigure connections to peer nodes to make the speed of data distribution in the P2P network near optimal.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

3. This is one of the craziest things I’ve seen in crypto. Balaji is burning a few million to ring the fire alarm and make everyone aware of what he believes is an impending attack on dollar holders. Counterparty is guaranteed $1million (minus BTC price) if he just buys one additional BTC (or an option to purchase more).

This way the foreign central banks can have dollars to absorb the treasuries from the foreign banks.

59. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python. Unless you have full anonymity, you WILL be cross-chain bridged to IRL law. Some DAOs will learn this the hard way.

62. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners.

63. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke.

65. Rep. Foster (Cryptophobe): “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto?

66. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).

Signature Bank was also shut down by regulators.

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

Many thanks, greatly appreciated."

Id like to better protect my ada now that ledger supports cardano. I assume I should create a new ada account on my ledger and then send the funds to that new account. Is this correct or is there a better option?"

When it comes to recovery phrase I pay super attention.

Is there anything I need to be aware of, be extremely careful of?

3/18/2023,"To make it easy for all Cardano members to obtain information that reduces misinformation and baises from 3rd party sources, should a new group of news evaluators be formed?

My opinion is that such news evaluators should summarise information in an easy-to-read format, and that they be apart of the MBOs as they would be obliged to reinforce the Cardano Constitution.

That way the voters and dReps could more be more easily informed that leads to more efficient decisions to be made. This hopefully leads to an increase in community engagement and more effective means of governance for the Cardano ecosystem.

What are your opinions on such a proposal?"

I’m not pointing fingers, but isn’t this behavior indicative of selling off good amounts of coinage. I mention to a co-worker (the lone soul at work who also talks crypto) and he immediately thought of “the team selling off”trying to make money. 

So, I’m here to ask the experts, are we seeing this kind of behavior with WRT or is it just crappy timing?"

I am rookie in this space. There are some cardano stake pools with staking rewards like 25%+.

67. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

How: smart contract represents a building passport and NFTs held within the contract represent its qualities / needs / certifications 

Needs: an L1 that will remain performant & cheap for decades, secure permissioning (literal lives are at stake otherwise)

I got my start in EVM and have my doubts any of those chains can handle it. Do you all think cardano is the better choice? Why?"

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

3/16/2023,"Total Value Locked (TVL) has been rising steeply since the start of February 2023 and is making new ATH in a bear market when that is not usual. Cardano reached its previous ATH in March 2022 when TVL was at 324M ADA. We are now at 362M ADA (118M USD). DeFi on Cardano is unique in this respect. For all other major smart contract platforms, the number of native coins locked in DeFi is deeply below ATH. TVL in dollar value is low in the case of Cardano compared to some platforms where it is locked up to over a billion dollars and even tens of billions of dollars for Ethereum. If the trend holds, Cardano has a chance to catch up to the current champions within a year or two.

3/17/2023,"Cardano projects show great potential with public teams, clear roadmaps, and promising KPIs. However, despite their excellence, attracting new users to the community remains a challenge. Many projects assume that they can provide the best solutions for users without considering that newcomers may find it difficult to understand the new mechanisms. This is where Whiteboard Cardano comes in as a solution that prioritizes video marketing and simplifying complex technical terms into understandable examples. By focusing on content and image quality, Whiteboard Cardano aims to create a welcoming and approachable environment for new members to learn about blockchain technology and Cardano. Marketing is a critical aspect that cannot be overlooked, as even the best projects may struggle without enough users. Therefore, Whiteboard Cardano's emphasis on marketing will be essential in bringing new users to the Cardano community and promoting the growth of the ecosystem.

3/16/2023,"Today marks the much-awaited launch of the Rosen Bridge testnet, a significant step towards facilitating cross-chain communication between Cardano and Ergo. This collaboration between the two blockchain projects has the potential to yield significant benefits for both ecosystems. Here are a few reasons why Cardano and Ergo are a perfect match:

Security and Consensus Diversity: Cardano's Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and Ergo's Proof of Work (PoW) offer unique security benefits. The collaboration can lead to exploring new ways to enhance security and optimize consensus mechanisms.

Interoperability: The Rosen Bridge will enable seamless cross-chain transactions between Cardano and Ergo, creating a more unified blockchain ecosystem. This enhanced interoperability can drive adoption and encourage developers to create cross-chain applications.

Complementary Features: Both platforms offer features that can benefit each other. Cardano's smart contract infrastructure, Plutus, and Ergo's privacy-enhancing Sigma protocols can inspire innovations and lead to more comprehensive solutions.

UTXO and eUTXO Models: Cardano and Ergo both utilize the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, with Ergo adopting an extended version (eUTXO). This shared foundation enables better compatibility, allowing for more efficient cross-chain interactions and the development of innovative solutions that leverage the strengths of both models.

Expanding the Ecosystem: The partnership between Cardano and Ergo has the potential to attract more developers, users, and investors to both projects. This expanded ecosystem can foster the development of new decentralized applications (dApps) and use cases.

With the launch of the Rosen Bridge testnet, the collaboration between Cardano and Ergo is poised to bring significant value to both communities. Their combined strengths in security, interoperability, complementary features, UTXO/eUTXO models, and an expanded ecosystem set the stage for a bright future in the blockchain space."

I am providing liquidity to the ADA/SHEN pool and farming. The rewards breakdown states this:

**Sum of Pool Fees APR, Pool Staking APR, Farm APR and Farm Boosting APR**

I am not boosting so I should be getting 3.009 % + 1.639 % + 2.815 % = 7.463% APR

I can see some WRT rewards coming in, but they add up to nowhere near 7.4%, in fact are less than half that. Should I see all of these rewards there or is that actually only the Farm APR I see there?

If so, where can I see the total rewards I am actually getting? Thanks"

Overall, I do think it’s super positive how user-friendly the app is and the support it has for several assets in the Cardano Ecosystem. 

On the downside, there is no sign of fiat loans yet, so the app is very similar to Liqwid but with a better design and with more assets supported for the loans."
3/15/2023,Been staking with them for a while but haven't been paying much attention. Is this still a worthwhile project or should I be looking elsewhere?
3/15/2023," 

In recent debates, it has become apparent that people don't fully understand how staking and block production are related. Some people mistakenly believe that if a pool started using Contingent Staking (CS) functionality and required KYC from stakers, it would simultaneously start censoring transactions. In this context, the two functionalities are completely separate. SPOs can already filter transactions today and do not need CS. Conversely, a pool that would require KYC from stakers can insert a transaction into the block regardless of the fact that the blockchain address is blacklisted. Let's describe it in more detail.

# TLDR

* SPOs can censor transactions by modifying the source code of the Cardano node. 
* Even if 80% of the pools censor transactions according to the same blacklist, the blacklisted transactions still get into the blockchain through the other 20% of the pools.
* If regulators want to force SPOs to censor transactions, they can do it today.
* If SPOs want to successfully operate a pool, their conduct must be consistent with the wishes of ADA holders. The degree of censorship of transactions on Cardano is primarily determined by ADA holders.
* Censorship is prevented by decentralization, permissionless ness, and openness of Cardano. 
* A staker can delegate ADA to a pool and still the pool can censor transactions of the delegator. 
* If the ADA holders refuse KYC and transaction censorship then no central authority has a chance to curb their will.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

59. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python. Unless you have full anonymity, you WILL be cross-chain bridged to IRL law. Some DAOs will learn this the hard way.

61. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners.

62. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUUy4\_KwNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUUy4_KwNU)
63. Rep. Emmer (Pro-Crypto) called the current regulatory approach “lazy & destructive…that is chilling innovation.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5670](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5670)
64. Rep. Foster (Cryptophobe): “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto?

65. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure). [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703)
66. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

3/14/2023,"The US government is proposing to impose a 30% tax on crypto mining. The government's decision can essentially drive Proof-of-Work miners out of the country in a relatively non-violent manner. If mining is unprofitable, there is no point in continuing. The U.S. and China are the two most economically powerful countries in the world that are pushing mining out of their territory. The problem with mining is that it is easy to detect and cannot be operated unless conditions are favorable. This contrasts with Proof-of-Stake networks like Cardano. If you hold ADA coins, the government can't restrict you from participating in the decentralization of Cardano and getting the rewards. According to the analytics firm Morning Consult, 4% of Americans held ADAs in 2022. Any of them can participate in staking and very likely do. While Bitcoin's decentralization will decrease as mining is curtailed, Cardano's decentralization is gradually increasing every year. Dependence on a physical resource is an annoying and so far seemingly effective attack vector.

# TLDR

* Crypto miners would have reporting requirements on the amount and type of electricity used. It kills anonymous mining. 
* PoW mining will likely shift from the US to Kazakhstan and Russia, where fossil fuels are used to produce electricity.
* Staking itself is essentially a very hidden and anonymous activity that is almost impossible to curb and hard to prove.
* Just keeping SEED in your head can make you an active staker.
* In PoS networks, greed has a positive effect on decentralization.
* Staking is equally available and profitable everywhere in the world.
* A virtual resource is much more difficult to fight than a physical one.

# Bitcoin mining tax 

China dominated Bitcoin mining for many years. In 2020, its share of mining was over 80%. The Chinese government decided to drive the miners out of the country, and for a short time, it succeeded. By 2021, the mining share had dropped to almost zero. Now mining is slowly returning to China. Bitcoin mining today is dominated by the US with 35%, Kazakhstan with 18%, Russia with 11% and Canada with 10%.  It seems that regulation will again significantly change the share of mining, especially in the US. US crypto miners could eventually be subject to a 30% tax on electricity costs under a budget proposal by the President aimed at reducing mining activity. The tax will apply to all types of energy, regardless of whether it is from the grid or produced by miners. The tax is expected to start at the end of 2023, phased in over three years at a rate of 10% a year, reaching the max 30% tax rate by the third year.

3/14/2023,"TLDR: Smart contracts that use PlutusV1 and/or PlutusTx are inefficient. There are alternatives developed/being developed, and for Cardano to operate at its full capacity, there needs to be (more) dApps written without using PlutusV1 and PlutusTx.

Kind of a long post, so bear with me. For those who are unaware, let me explain what PlutusV1 and PlutusTx are:

PlutusV1 is the original version of Cardano's smart contract platform (Plutus). The problem with it is that it is does not have reference inputs/scripts, which means that transactions that use a PlutusV1 smart contract have to include the entire smart contract into the transaction, which would cause more bloat in tx size; this is important because block sizes are limited to 88kb in Cardano, meaning the more bloat txs are, the less txs can fit into a block.

PlutusTx is the original way to write and compile smart contracts into Plutus Core (the actual programming language in which all Cardano smart contracts are compiled to and executed in). The problem with PlutusTx is very simple: it is very inefficient. To clarify, when I say inefficient, I am referring to 3 metrics: CPU usage, Mem usage, and script size. Smart contracts written using PlutusTx are very high in all 3.

So, what are the solutions? Well, I'm sure you all know that Vasil introduced PlutusV2, which added reference inputs/scripts, thus smart contracts using PlutusV2 don't have to be included entirely in a tx that uses them. Since smart contracts can't be updated, however, dApp devs have to rewrite smart contracts in PlutusV2 if they were previously deployed in V1 (some like JPEG store and MuesliSwap have done this).

Now, what about PlutusTx? Well, there are about half a dozen alternatives to PlutusTx (the ones I know are Plutarch, Pluto, Aiken, Helios, Scalus, Eopsin, Hebi, and Plu-ts), and all but one of them (Plutarch) don't even use Haskell. While these alternatives can vary in efficiency from one to another, they are all *much* more efficient than PlutusTx. A good example of this is a benchmark made by OpShin (the devs behind Hebi and Eopsin) that [you can see here](https://github.com/OpShin/plutus-bench#running). It doesn't include all the PlutusTx alternatives I listed, but it does show one thing: the second least efficient smart contract language (Eopsin) included in the benchmark has 12x less script size, 48x less CPU usage, and 42x less Memory usage than the PlutusTx-written smart contract. Keep in mind, that is just the difference between the least efficient and the second least efficient, meaning the difference between PlutusTx and the others is *even greater*.

As you can see, the solutions are already here or are in development. DJED, WingRiders, SundaeSwap, and Minswap (for the most part) are all using PlutusV1 (I don't know if they are using PlutusTx or not because they are closed source). Muesliswap and JPEG store use PlutusV2, but they are written in PlutusTx. Spectrum Finance is taking a good first step in using both PlutusV2 and Plutarch, and hopefully more will follow suit.

I will note that I am aware that PlutusV2 are the PlutusTx alternatives are still relatively new (with PlutusTx alternatives still being in development), but I though that it was important to mention them anyway to show the difference that they can have for Cardano's smart contract throughput. I was thinking in particular about Input Endorsers and how its full capacity will be hindered if bloated smart contracts are still in use. It seems that Input Endorsers is years away, and in my opinion, Cardano dApps should have completely abandoned smart contracts using PlutusV1 and PlutusTx by the time Input Endorsers roll out."

53. Paul Krugman hilariously complains about being locked out of his Venmo account. He predicted the impact of the internet would be about as much as the fax machine and has subsequently opposed crypto.

59. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python. Unless you have full anonymity, you WILL be cross-chain bridged to IRL law. Some DAOs will learn this the hard way.

61. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners.

62. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke.

64. Rep. Foster (Cryptophobe):  “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto?

65. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).

66. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.”  [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

68. Now we’re dealing with U.S. bank runs. Among the casualties was Silicon Valley Bank where Centre (the Circle/Coinbase joint entity that issues USDC) was keeping $3.3 billion of the $43ish billion backing USDC. Signature Bank was also shut down by regulators.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

# Hello there, beautiful soul!

Hope this message finds you well.  


The third month of the year is upon us. Not too late to begin working towards your goals that you'd like to materialize this year! In the same fashion, projects across the ecosystem are working diligently towards theirs. To learn more about how some of the past Catalyst challenges have been doing so far - we've had three great presentations this week that provided insights for all of us to reflect upon. You'll find the links further below.   


Otherwise, it's very heartwarming seeing the elevated interest in all things governance. Liveliness is one of the key pillars to produce a good set of outcomes. I appreciate everyone who has engaged on the topic of Voltaire and continues doing so. Many exciting community tools are being spun up.  


I also commend everyone who continues to engage in a respectful discourse. As a whole, opinions may vary person to person. Let's make sure we always take a deep breath before responding to the other side of the argument. Let's practice pro-active listening and considerate responses.  


So - what's the latest? Dive in.

# Challenge Team Updates 

https://preview.redd.it/kgcoq5j39kna1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f5feab5011ec404c5ad5a4d47afefa86e51cbb4d

This week we've seen another three distinct presentations from Challenge Teams (CTs). These teams are a fundamental piece in the puzzle to help resurface trends and insights from the past challenges that took place in the Catalyst funding rounds.  


In the most recent rounds, some of these requirements are gradually expanding, such as with the introduction of a milestones pilot in F9. It requires community endorsements on reviews for the achievement of milestones that projects submit to receive further funding. Historically, CTs have had three key deliverables. 

1. Present the concept of the specific challenge to the community when Fund begins
2. To onboard funded projects in that challenge once governance is over and the execution stage begins
3. With time passing, to reflect back on the successes, failures, insights, and learnings about challenge effectiveness and outcomes - collectively addressing a question - what return on intention has the community received? 

This week we saw presentations that address the third deliverable on the list from these teams:

* Fund 8 CT: Developer Ecosystem
   * [Timestamped TH segment](https://www.youtube.com/live/FpZf99M1i4M?feature=share&t=605)

# Voltaire/CIP-1694 

https://preview.redd.it/jec8lwy49kna1.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3185c6f11590837441e06423640109dd4f1d851f

In recent weeks, the overall interest in Cardano governance has increased tremendously. It is great to see civic engagement via lively, constructive discourse and debates on the proposed CIP-1694 and beyond.  


Meanwhile, as the outcome of the first workshop held in Colorado is currently being processed and will be published in the coming weeks - the community is stepping up with various initiatives to help keep the conversation going. [LidoNation](https://twitter.com/LidoNation) has introduced a [www.1694.io](http://www.1694.io/) portal, [Catalyst Swarm](https://twitter.com/CatalystSwarm) has [held a workshop](https://forum.cardano.org/t/overview-over-discussion-on-cip-1694-twenty-seven-and-a-half-open-questions/114885) and [also arranged a bounty call for translations](https://twitter.com/danny_cryptofay/status/1633539230327529480?s=20), and Governance Guild spearheaded [Voltaire News! hub](http://bit.ly/voltaire-news).   


What is Voltaire News! specifically? Check out [this timestamped segment](https://www.youtube.com/live/FpZf99M1i4M?feature=share&t=3078) from the last town hall to learn more. But in a nutshell: [a new collaborative community newslette](http://bit.ly/voltaire-news)r started by Governance Guild to help the community keep track of the CIP-1694 debate.  


If you fancy another set of views - I recommend reviewing 'let's talk governance' twitter space held by Charles Hoskinson (CEO of IOG) this past weekend. You can catch all (almost) [three hours of it here](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1632211572511711232?s=20).  


If you wish to add your perspectives to CIP 1694, make sure to share them [here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380). Add your voice as the era of Voltaire rolls out!

# Last week in CIPs 

https://preview.redd.it/fk3vu3q69kna1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d973f1cf370d1ce1175257325cf5fd3fcee8eb94

Here's the recap from my colleague [Ryan Williams](https://twitter.com/Ryun1_) that writes these fantastic CIP round-ups. I figured you'd like them, too. So here's the latest to get up to speed. You can catch past and future summaries [via this Cardano forum thread here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/what-happened-in-cips-last-week/109101) as well. If are unsure what CIPs are about - please check out this link to dive deeper: [https://cips.cardano.org/](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). 

**RW:** What happened in CIPs last week?

* [CIP-???? | First class errors / Make Plutus pure](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/469) **\[New Proposal\]**:
   * This proposal suggests making error  
 a first-class value within Plutus.
* [CIP-???? | Native Asset Policy Registration/Information Certificates](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/467) **\[New Proposal\]**:
   * This proposal defines a method for attaching off-chain metadata to native asset minting policy.

**RW:** Continued Recommendations:

* [CIP-1694? | A proposal for entering the Voltaire phase](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380)
   * This proposes a revision of Cardano's on-chain governance system to support the new requirements for Voltaire.
   * This is a very important CIP and has had tonnes of recent engagement from the community; should see further refinement in the coming weeks.
* [CIP-85? | Sums-of-products in Plutus Core](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/455):
   * This CIP proposes to add native support for datatypes to Plutus Core, and to use that support to implement more efficient interchange of the script context between the ledger and scripts.
   * Lots of new engagement and discussion.

**Next Meeting:**

* CIP Editors Meeting #62:
   * March 14th 9:30AM UTC.
   * Postponed from Feb 28
* Held on Discord - [here](https://discord.gg/4yukWV3khD).
* Agenda TBD.

Further varied governance and Catalyst community conversations can be also followed on [the official Cardano forum here](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). Don't be shy to be part of the conversation. 

# Leadership Academy dRep Book Club - The Power of Experiments

The second meeting of the community dRep Book Club met on March 8, 2023 to discuss this book: The Power of Experiments. In The Power of Experiments: Decision-Making in a Data-Driven World, Michael Luca and Max Bazerman explore the value of experiments and the ways in which they can improve organizational decisions. Drawing on real-world experiments and case studies, Luca and Bazerman show that going by gut is no longer enough—successful leaders need frameworks for moving between data and decisions. [Recording from this discussion can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITZ8nF03vAU) \- learn more how it might apply to Catalyst and possible ethical questions this could raise.

# Learnings from beyond Cardano borders

It always pays to lift the head from time to time and look around what others are building - what challenges are they facing, if any lessons learned could be applied. One of the places I like to visit is Ethereum, and more specifically their somewhat equivalent of Catalyst - by name of Gitcoin. Recently, they've published a new way of how to combat bad actors and sybil resistance. Gitcoin is interesting because it has been iterating for a while on quadratic approaches to funding. A point of conversation in Catalyst as well.  


This is a ***""Gitcoin Passport""*** Case study:  


*""Numerous Internet-based social entities need help ensuring each individual is a real person and does not set up multiple accounts. Sybil attacks rely on an attacker creating numerous identities that are not easily distinguishable from legitimate users. By creating a mechanism to detect and reject these false identities, web3 communities can be kept safe from malicious actors.""*

It was selected to be a part of [@NucastIO](https://twitter.com/NucastIO) film festival. It runs now from March 12 to March 18. How does it work? [Learn in this thread below](https://twitter.com/petr_adafilms/status/1635186548810592258?s=20)!

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems. The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

\## Want to build on Cardano?

**New modules will roll out every Monday from now thru May.** 

Take a look + stay tuned."
3/13/2023,"Delegation Representatives (DReps) will decide on important issues concerning the future of Cardano. Should they be rewarded for this work? And what about the ADA holders who delegated their decision-making authority to the DReps, should they be rewarded as well? Let's think about this and look for answers.

# TLDR

* CIP-1694 has elements of direct and representative democracy. 
* We should honor the principle of 1 ADA = 1 vote, but this does not necessarily apply to the size of the reward.
* All DReps should be rewarded fairly, even those with a smaller stake, but at the same time, we need to consider the size of the stake.
* If all ADA holders are not rewarded, but only DReps, the system relies on ADA holders not being greedy and behaving responsibly.
* Most people will behave rationally when voting because they are making decisions about their own wealth.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

Let’s go….

Newly Covered Today:

1. CMC is tweeting about IOG’s Sidechain toolkit? [https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1634773712468852736](https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1634773712468852736) 
2. Now we’re dealing with U.S. bank runs. Among the casualties was Silicon Valley Bank where Centre (the Circle/Coinbase joint entity that issues USDC) was keeping $3.3 billion of the $43ish billion backing USDC. Signature Bank was also shut down by regulators.

4. The Feds were taking bids for anyone to acquire SVB until 2pm Eastern on Sunday. The big question on Sunday was whether the Feds will cover all uninsured depositors. They decided they will and that also applies to Signature Bank.

6. Yellen said NO to a bailout for SVB on Sunday. She’s obviously got bigger macro concerns. But, it’s funny how that fits perfectly with a strategy of suppressing stablecoins generally.

3/12/2023,With Djed being launched for a month and surviving it's first rough days by keeping the peg I believe it is a great time to ask for feedback to the people involved with the stablecoin! What was your experience? I personaly have not touched it but am considering doing so if prices go down more. Please give feedback!
3/13/2023,"'m staking on my Daedalus wallet and currently delegating to a pool of specific ispo's.

The other day, I saw an article about a person who lost all their coins due to the exploitation of ledger's smart contract, and it made my heart hurt.

Therefore, a question arose, but ispo only grants claim rights to wallets that have delegated a specific epoch, but some ispo projects (sundae swap riso, etc.) connect wallets to official sites, etc. and requires a process to claim tokens in a smart contract.

If the project itself was a scam, I think there is a possibility that a malicious smart contract could compromise the entire wallet.

If the ispo token is airdropped to your wallet, you don't need to compromise your wallet.

Why don't all ispo projects distribute tokens with aidrop?"
3/12/2023,"Without being a developer or programmer, is there a way for casual Cardano users to audit the smart contracts they've interacted with in the past, or that their wallet may still be (perhaps unknowingly) interacting with?  Either through something like Cardoscan or through one's wallet itself?

There are a few examples that come to mind, but it seems like the knowledge would transferable to many more situations:

* [JPG.store](https://JPG.store) bills itself as a ""non-custodial"" NFT marketplace, however when listing an NFT for sale, the token in question appears to leave a user's wallet, seemingly contradicting the marketplace's premise.  Taking the NFT off the marketplace returns the token to one's wallet, and presumably upon sale one would receive ADA to their wallet instead, however is there a way to ""read"" the contract (as opposed to simply verifying that the contract on your computer screen and hardware wallet screen match) to see what exactly the parameters are that you're agreeing to?
* Sundae Swap had a pretty messy ICO, however users are now able to claim their rewards.  There's been a number of users who have reported seeing that the smart contract they interacting with to claim their rewards is requesting *sending* tens of thousands of SUNDAE to get their own (tens of) SUNDAE.  While it's possible this is sloppy wording innocently related to the UTXO on Sundae Swap's end, in crypto it's commonly understood that a trustless approach is the wisest.  How would one more precisely scrutinize what Sundae Swap's smart contract is asking of them?
* Speaking of trustless, is it in ***any way*** possible for a smart contract to include a time-delay, or for it to be changed after the fact (vs. being instant and/or immutable)?  If we assume a more malicious intent, or even simple ineptness, what if JPG Store suddenly shuttered its windows?  Would users automatically get back their listed NFTs in lieu of being able to ask the marketplace to take down their listing?  If a user agrees to a smart contract they don't fully understand, is it possible they *think* they've spent a nominal transaction fee (say, 2 ADA), but the full contract actually says that after X days their wallet sends an additional Y ADA to a third-party wallet (or that the contract has been changed after the fact for this to be the case)?"

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

3/12/2023,"Hi to all Cardano Fam,
Can someone please explain if I really done that right. I was satisfied with my Cardano Yoroi wallet , not just one ;-) .. recently came ledger device ,installed all and word phrase etc. 
Installed new desktop Yoroi and connect with ledger , that means I have no secure phase words from Yoroi. Desktop Yoroi receiving ok, sending ok.
All was done on ledger.
Is that all alright, I thought I would need my ledger 24 words to send from Yoroi . Just few clicks on ledger was. Am I more secured now or before with Yoroi alone and Yoroi seedphrases.
When I would need this ledger seedphrases afterall? 
Thanks!
Appreciate any help!"
3/12/2023," Hi Lads,

&#x200B;

Sorry if this has been mentioned in the Crypto Forum but I couldnt post due to my limited karma.  To me as an average user this post has been the most alarming  security issue that I have ever seen. Sorry for being alarmed but its just my point of view.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11oenu9/my\_wallet\_has\_been\_hacked\_for\_270000\_usd\_please/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11oenu9/my_wallet_has_been_hacked_for_270000_usd_please/)

In short, He signed a transaction on his ledger with a set amount and he actually gave someone permission to sign a contract on his behalf, which eventually drained his USDC.

Lads do ye think this is extremely vulnerable to an average user ,me included. We're looking for adoption. Anyone could make this mistake. And I'm not talking about reddit users who know the ins and outs of the technology. I thought I was solid once I had my cold wallet but I'm a bit thrown back by this.

So the few questions I have?

Is it just an ERC20 smart contract issue?

How do you spot something like this?  I hear people talking about ""modified functions"", which goes way over my head. If im signing a transaction I check the amount, fee amount and address.  What else should i be looking out for?

Again we are talking about a revolutionary technology that's supposed to change the world and to have mass adoption."
3/12/2023,"I want to know if I interacted with a smart contract that had similar functionality. How do I find out or check?

I Interacted with JPG store and Adahandle in the past. 

Thanks!"
3/11/2023,"I've just stumbled across \[this post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11oenu9/my\_wallet\_has\_been\_hacked\_for\_270000\_usd\_please/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11oenu9/my_wallet_has_been_hacked_for_270000_usd_please/)) where OP got their wallet drained by signing an Ethereum transaction that allows unlimited spending. The Ethereum ""feature"" allowing this is described for example \[here\]([https://kalis.me/unlimited-erc20-allowances/](https://kalis.me/unlimited-erc20-allowances/)).

Can this happen with Cardano as well? Is it possible to sign a transaction so that at some point in the future your funds are transferred out because you've allowed unlimited spending of a token or even of ADA?"

thanks"
3/11/2023,"Just curious but aside from the entire market dropping, does cardano have any ties to USDC which could lead to further implications?"
3/11/2023,"Hey folks.

I am very much a Bitcoin guy - I understand (at least on a basic level) what it does, why people would want to buy it and why it will potentially be worth more in the future.

Blockchains such as Cardano go straight over my head. There seems to be a a lot of talk of smart contracts, scalability and TPS but I have not been able to find a straight answer on why this is game changing technology and what value this is going to add to the world in the coming decades.

Admittedly I own a little bit of ADA and ALGO and have tried to engage with the ecosystems. I have staked my ADA, participated in Algorand governance, played around with an Algorand DeFi platform (Yieldly for anybody familiar) and swapped my coins for a bunch of tokens that didn't do anything, bought an NFT and plan on checking out voting through the Yoroi wallet. But I can't help but feeling like none of this has any real-world application.

I want to spend this crypto winter studying up on crypto and get my head around a bunch of concepts I didn't get last time. I would love if somebody could ELI5 what value Cardano is potentially going to provide in the real world ten years from now? How is it going to benefit me and my family, even if it working behind the scenes? I am genuinely trying to understand!

Thanks!"
3/11/2023,"Maybe some of you already noticed. Cardano is making more and more progress in TVL rankings. When i saw Cardano at the first time in this ranking, it was not even in top 50... Slow but steady Cardano is becoming an important Blockchain for DEFI! Yes, Cardano is just on rank 21. But its doing great. Not in hurry! We have the time!"
3/11/2023,"Hey guys, I believe that it would be amazing if companies like GameStop that are investing into crypto and creating their own wallets could adopt Cardano, mass adoption of cardano would be a popular service like a game or a stream company using Cardano to interact with it's client base. I'm not an expert but please entertain the idea, what would it take to see this happen?"

Let’s go….

Newly Covered Today:

1. Big Pey is launching something called Atrium Lab. [https://twitter.com/bigpeyYT/status/1633830948575010816](https://twitter.com/bigpeyYT/status/1633830948575010816) 
2. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python. Unless you have full anonymity, you WILL be cross-chain bridged to IRL law. Some DAOs will learn this the hard way. [https://twitter.com/lex\_node/status/1633925979004436481](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1633925979004436481) 
3. The NY Attorney General just filed against Kucoin for being an unregistered broker-dealer. Here’s the important part: they’re alleging that ETH is a security and a commodity. Their argument is not complex...it’s very straightforward. [https://www.docdroid.net/Myyp0yz/kucoin-pdf](https://www.docdroid.net/Myyp0yz/kucoin-pdf) 
4. Silvergate was a failure of fractional reserve banking, not of crypto. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1633608132713938945](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1633608132713938945) 
5. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners. [https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget\_fy2023.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf) 
6. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUUy4\_KwNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUUy4_KwNU) 
7. Rep. Emmer (Pro-Crypto) called the current regulatory approach “lazy & destructive…that is chilling innovation.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5670](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5670) 
8. Rep. Foster (Anti-Crypto):  “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto?

9. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).  [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703) 
10. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.”  [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

10. SEC Do Kwon complaint alleges that Luna,UST, MIR, & wLuna are all securities.

28. In the class action suit against Dapper Labs (creators of CryptoKitties) alleging the NBA Top Shot Moments NFTs are securities, the court has denied the motion to dismiss. This is just the court saying that if all the factual allegations are taken as true, then there is a plausible claim for relief. This is not a ruling on the status of NFTs as securities or not. But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

37. Some are raising concerns Base may be a colossal mistake since Coinbase is the only major SEC regulated crypto company and there could be many different tokens the SEC considers securities and many types of DeFi transaction traversing this L2, this could accelerate regulatory pressure on centralized L2s as broker/dealers.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

They recently [announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MELD_Defi/status/1632800051218075649) their ""public"" testnet, but only give 100 access passes. Does anyone here got the access and can share the experience, screenshots, or a video? I'm curious on how its turning out"
3/9/2023,"Ergonauts are warning not to send more than 20 different tokens in a single tx to a ledger because that would make the box (utxo) too large for ledger's memory to access. Given the similarities of Ergo and Cardano, is there a similar memory limitation for cardano's utxos? And if not, then why? What is cardano doing differently so it doesn't run into this issue?"
3/9/2023," 

In the past, there have been several cases of people losing their digital assets because hackers managed to exploit the vulnerabilities of blockchain wallets. It is important to note that this is not the fault of the blockchain itself, but of the team responsible for developing the hacked wallet. The security of your digital assets depends on choosing the right wallet and, most importantly, your behavior. Let's take a look at what Cardano as a network is responsible for in protecting digital assets, what wallet developers are responsible for, and what you can do.

# TLDR

* The Cardano network will not allow a third party to steal your property or restrict you from disposing of it.
* Cardano separates user data (digital assets) from the provided services. The interface to the service (wallets) can be provided by any third party.
* It is up to you to protect your digital assets through seed.
* Cardano can never be hacked when it comes to protecting your assets and the right to dispose of them freely.

# What's the difference between Cardano and Twitter?

The wallet is the interface to the blockchain. If you need to receive or send assets, you control the wallet in a similar way to, say, Twitter. Twitter is a social network. At its core, it's just a protocol that you access through a mobile app or web browser. That's the interface for you to Twitter. You can read other users' tweets and at any time you can write your own tweet for the whole world to see. Through the interface, you enter instructions that the protocol executes as you wish. There is a fundamental difference between Twitter and a blockchain wallet. Twitter is a centralized entity that is responsible for the protocol and infrastructure. The protocol is built on a client-server architecture. The company owns the servers that users connect to through an interface that is also supplied by Twitter. It can be said that Twitter has control over the protocol, the infrastructure, and also the interface. One implication is that you don't digitally own a Twitter account. You only have access to it through your login credentials. How is blockchain different? Let's explain it on Cardano.

Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
3/8/2023,"That is the major use case for Meld which is a Defi and RealFi protocol building on Cardano.

Your crypto will be safe in a smart contract generating yield, while you can use that cash loan to buy a house, start a business or pay expenses, without having to sell crypto and give up on the price appreciation.

If you want to know exactly how this works and the progress that Meld has made so far watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao\_VUJvluv0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao_VUJvluv0) 

Certainly better than having to sell my crypto to do any of that don’t you think?"
3/8/2023,"Cardano switched to Proof-of-Stake consensus on July 29, 2020. This was in epoch 208 and the first block was minted by one of the Genesis pools operated by IOG. The block had a Height of 4,490,511. 10 days later, the first community pool minted a block. The pool had the ticker 1PCT6. This occurred in epoch 211 and slot 449. Shortly after, in slot 729, the second block minted by the community pool occurred. The pool had the ticker CRDNS and was operated by Cardanians. The third place belongs to the pool with the ticker JAPAN2. Let's add that there were 400 pools up and running when Cardano switched to PoS. Today, all the blocks are minted by community pools. There are 3200 registered pools, and approximately 1200 of them produce blocks. At the time of writing the article is missing about two days before the small anniversary. Cardano will soon celebrate 4,000,000 blocks minted through the PoS consensus.

# TLDR

* So far, Cardano needed no coordinated restart of the network. There was no major issue related to PoS.
* Cardano mints roughly 4,320 blocks per day.
* So far, PoS has successfully passed the test of time for the third year.

55. Some are raising concerns Base may be a colossal mistake since Coinbase is the only major SEC regulated crypto company and there could be many different tokens the SEC considers securities and many types of DeFi transaction traversing this L2, this could accelerate regulatory pressure on centralized L2s as broker/dealers.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
3/7/2023,"There will only be 45,000,000,000 ADA coins in the Cardano ecosystem. New ADA coins will gradually be released from the reserve and eventually, we will get to the point of having almost all coins in circulation. People believe that cryptocurrencies could serve as money that could hold value in the long term. Do you know how such an economy would work? Very differently than you know it today, and you might not like it. The price of goods could gradually decrease. Wages would gradually fall in nominal terms. It would be more difficult to repay debt. It might be impossible for governments to solve sudden serious problems economically. It is inconceivable for the present indebted governments to transform an inflationary economy into a deflationary one. Moreover, how can we create a new economy that is fair for all who want to join it? Algorithmic stablecoins may be the only possible way to create better money. ADA, like BTC and other similar coins, can be an amazing reserve currency, but it will probably never be a good medium of exchange.

# TLDR

* It was necessary to abandon the gold standard in order to stimulate the economy. 
* Are you ready to live debt-free? You may be, but governments are not. 
* It would be difficult for people to change their thinking if we switched to deflationary money. 
* Users can use DJED as a medium of exchange while holding ADA as a store of value. The Cardano ecosystem will provide both functions.
* All assets in the world are volatile, including gold. There is no reason to think that ADA or BTC will be more stable than existing assets.
* Cryptocurrencies can be a good store of value if we use their value for something useful. One of the most useful tools in the world is currency.

# How would a currency with a fixed monetary policy work?

Deflationary money refers to a monetary system where the value of money increases over time, leading to a decrease in the general price level. In other words, with deflationary money, the purchasing power of money increases over time. Each unit of currency can buy more goods and services than before. Cryptocurrency fans believe this is a desirable feature for a medium of exchange. Who wouldn't want to have more for not doing anything? Just keep the money and the individual would get rich. One of the current false narratives around cryptocurrencies is that such money is better than inflationary fiat currencies. However, one must see the difference between a medium of exchange and a store of value. These functions of money cannot be combined together to work well in the long term.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
3/7/2023,"Hello, I wanted to know what happens if I'm staking and I want to claim my rewards. Will I have to wait for the 25-day cycle again to see new rewards, or this is something that only happens when you deposit ADA in your wallet? Thanks!"
3/6/2023,"I have an agricultural organization (small scale) in Uganda that focuses on animal breeding, meat production, tree planting (for both lumber and carbon offset).

One of the annoying aspects is wiring money through my bank. It's always a hassle and costs 50 dollars a transaction. I'm curious if anyone has experience using crypto from the states to African countries. Do they have access to exchanges that easily connect to their bank?

Also curious about any other projects people would recommend that I look into (similar to world Mobile token. I think that's really cool but it seems like it's strictly in Zanzibar)

I Would like to utilize the power and convenience of crypto on this project.

Any advice is appreciated."

First of all mobile so excuse my formatting. 
I have a (maybe dumb) questions. I saw on coincodex site (desktop version) that the inflation rate is 7.5% but the staking reward rate is +-3,5%. 

How come the inflation rate is so high? 
Aren’t we all losing money because are rewards don’t keep up with inflation? 

Thanks in advance!"
3/6/2023,"The Cardano ecosystem is preparing to launch decentralized governance (on-chain governance). Therefore, new roles will be introduced: a constitutional committee and delegation representatives (DReps). Each ADA holder will be able to register themselves as a DRep. SPOs can become DReps if they register. Similar to how ADA holders delegate coins to pools, it will be possible to delegate decision-making power to DReps. Just as the number of blocks that a pool mint depends on the total stake, the amount of decision-making power will depend on the number of coins delegated to DReps. Why is the role of DReps important to Cardano?

**TLDR**

* Choosing a DRep will be a similar process to choosing a pool.
* DReps should have good expert knowledge and moral credit to become a representative of ADA holders. 
* On-chain governance can be much more flexible in the exchange of DReps than is the case with the conventional government.
* Decentralization is about the distribution of power, just like democracy. 
* Cardano should be first and foremost a community that uses and cares for the technology solutions and ecosystem.
* The team within each blockchain project can be seen as a center of power. If this center of power is to be weakened, someone must take over its decision-making power.

# Hello there, beautiful soul!

Hope this message finds you well.  


It is that time of the week when you get to catch up on all things Catalyst. A lot is happening and the ecosystem is as busy as ever. It's literally challenging to keep up with all the fantastic work that the communities continue to do. With all seriousness, none of Cardano would be possible as it is today without the contributions of every one of you. Here's the virtual high five for you. Keep up the great work - I see you.   


Meanwhile, this week during town hall - we've seen awesome presentations from [Discord Social Credential](https://www.youtube.com/live/M35dcIh4yGc?feature=share&t=570); [CardanoPress - ISPO Dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/live/M35dcIh4yGc?feature=share&t=853); [Catalyst Swarm DAO tools](https://www.youtube.com/live/M35dcIh4yGc?feature=share&t=1285) and a great progress update from [Cyber Security Community Support](https://www.youtube.com/live/M35dcIh4yGc?feature=share&t=1771). When asked about the number one security tip? Just don't click links if you don't know what you're doing. Definitely worth a listen and follow. However, there's a whole world outside this one town hall. So what has been happening?  


Let's dive into what's the latest.

# Catalyst Circle Updates 

https://preview.redd.it/dycm5m9xk5ma1.png?width=2038&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6f5b1c06c17dac5a6501dfcfd6c3aaf7049b7037

Catalyst Circle V4 is well and truly up and running and while the representatives haven’t been featured on Town Hall since the voting ended, their collective work is taking shape and it certainly isn’t going unnoticed.  


The Catalyst Circle monitors the current state and future plans regarding Catalyst, aiming to detect and discuss concerns, objections and opportunities arising within the Catalyst ecosystem. Last week, in addition to establishing an evergreen Project Catalyst Circle handle on Twitter [@ProjectCCvX](http://twitter.com/projectCCvx), the Circle held an objective-setting workshop to form a set of directions that the reps propose to work on. The group also collaborated on a mission statement for Catalyst CircleV4:  


*CC: Our mission \[during our tenure\] is to create a centralized and standardized information management system and operational plan that is machine-readable and accessible through a one-stop-shop website that presents our organization's activities clearly and concisely*  


https://preview.redd.it/cww7dskyk5ma1.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3615e8428625b76142812e8d0df9744952f4e432

Other key ideas that arose from the workshop included creating a set of Catalyst Circle deliverables and metrics that can be measured and quantified. Also for Circle reporting and outputs (such as meetings, transcripts, and other data) to be accessible and reusable by the community. Importantly the representatives see the need to develop a Catalyst Circle framework, giving structure to their roles and responsibilities that they can hand over to the next community-elected representatives later in 2023.  


The Catalyst Circle will next be working to refine and better define the Catalyst Circle code of conduct which sets out the expectations and topics for individuals coming together to play an important role as an advisory body to Catalyst.  


Meanwhile - make sure to follow their Twitter account where you'll catch some of their messaging. Or fancy a question? They are now just a tag away at your service. [Give them follow here](https://twitter.com/ProjectCCvX) and share their profile wide.

What are the key questions being asked here?

* 🌟How do you manage your Catalyst projects?
* 🌟What tools and processes do you use?
* 🌟What would you want from a project-management dApp?

Group is conducting research into different approaches to project management in Catalyst, as part of [their F9 proposal *Open dApp Framework.*](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421050) 

* **When?** Tuesday, Mar 7 @ 4PM UTC
* **Focus?** *“Which project management tools are people using?”*

* **Miro Board link** \- [http://bit.ly/3xK0aSC](http://bit.ly/3xK0aSC)

This is a stand-alone session - you don’t need to have attended session 1 - but if you’re interested, [you can watch session 1 here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kRuWo1M45I) In Session 2, the topic will be about the tools you're currently using, any that you have tried, and how they worked for you. 

Further, looking after your privacy and your authorship - questions won't be about any proprietary information, and the data you will provide will be credited to you unless you prefer to stay anonymous.

There's no “one-size-fits-all” in project management - so whatever your approach to it, come and join in! 😊

# Voltaire/CIP-1694

https://preview.redd.it/xxi6pc66l5ma1.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c80177f7273f9b31f1be5b9f4ec9fbe8ed8d904f

Last week, a community-led roundtable took place on [the topic of CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380). You can catch the recap and outcome in last week’s newsletter or this [Cardano Forum recap here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/overview-over-discussion-on-cip-1694-twenty-seven-and-a-half-open-questions/114885). Worth a read.  


This week, a number of community members attended a focused technical workshop in Colorado (run by the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO and IOG) to review the mechanics of CIP 1694, the first in a number of community consultations planned for this year.  


Outputs from the meeting are now being collated and will be shared in due course for further community input. Meanwhile, here are some of the tweets I caught. See for yourself: [James](https://twitter.com/jamesdunseith/status/1630721783702900736?s=46&t=alNT69BhiDTH1Sl_En6RLA); [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamrusch/status/1631105463365558273?s=46&t=alNT69BhiDTH1Sl_En6RLA); [Pi](https://twitter.com/Quantumplation/status/1630715105334956032?s=20); [Mercy](https://twitter.com/wada_org/status/1630766151838973953?s=46&t=alNT69BhiDTH1Sl_En6RLA); [Juana](https://twitter.com/attiehjuana/status/1630796185635266561?s=46&t=alNT69BhiDTH1Sl_En6RLA); [Lloyd](https://twitter.com/radioastro/status/1630961500868190208?s=20); [Matthew](https://twitter.com/cryptstitution/status/1631165693315125248?s=20); [Patrick;](https://twitter.com/padierfind/status/1631472898337820674?s=46&t=alNT69BhiDTH1Sl_En6RLA) [Darlington & Kenric](https://twitter.com/adamrusch/status/1630738643848396801?s=46&t=alNT69BhiDTH1Sl_En6RLA); [Eystein](https://twitter.com/adanorthpool/status/1631115019575508992?s=20) to find a few. More community-driven opportunities to meet are expected to happen throughout this year.

The Cardano Foundation is pleased to invite you to the upcoming Women of Cardano online event, on 8 March 2023. Join them for panel discussions presenting and celebrating some of the outstanding contributions made by women to the Cardano ecosystem. The event will revolve around three key areas: businesses building on Cardano, the present and future of cNFTs (Cardano non-fungible tokens), and women in Catalyst. See you there?

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

https://preview.redd.it/plc89oael5ma1.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24a1db89a35e011035fa2d0823610b1c94493b6b

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems. The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

3/6/2023,"Does anyone know why Bitstamp does not support Cardano trading in the US?  It supports so many other coins/tokens, as well as supporting Cardano outside of the US. Very frustrating!"
3/6/2023,"Hello Everyone! I don't think I have share my Cardano Project on here yet. Thought I would do so.

I am providing Cyber Security Support to the Cardano Community for one year under my Catalyst Project. I started this on 1Nov2022, and will last until 31Oct2023. I will likely continue afterwards, but maybe not via Catalyst.

**I would ask each of you to check out my YouTube page and subscribe. I already have some very useful information uploaded.** [**https://www.youtube.com/@epochsec**](https://www.youtube.com/@epochsec)

You can also check out my other information:

Twitter - **holymacaronee** (my main account) and **epochsec\_io** (my project account)

[epochsec.io](https://epochsec.io) \- my main website which is the central place to find any doc/content/recordings/etc that I do.

[epochsec.gitbook.io](https://epochsec.gitbook.io) \- docs are here if you prefer this as well.

A little short summary of the overall points of interest:

1) I do twitter spaces every Sunday @ 0930 EST (done quite a few so far, 23-25), and joined many others.

2) I also hold meetings. I have met with at least 18 or more individuals and teams in Cardano. My support ranges greatly from basic questions, to routine support.

3) I have my website, epochsec(.)io where I centrally post everything, other than individual/team meetings.

4) I also post my document on there, but epochsec.gitbook(.)io as well. 5) I have now been doing YT as well, to give people that version of consuming knowledge and information. The YT channel covers security and related topics as well. Sometimes it does and will involve community members and Cardano Content, when Security Information is related. But this is done to help our Cardano Community.

5) And I also started doing 5min security tips every Friday on Cardano Over Coffee."

But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

3/5/2023,"Hi guys,

I finally listened to all the advice of pulling my crypto of CEX and transfered them to my Ledger. Thx for if you contributed to spreading that wisdom!

I must admit I'm little sad about not staking my ADA currently and I was wondering if someone has tips to stake ADA with ledger. Although it looks easy, it also says that I have to choose my staker carefully because otherwise funds could be lost. Therefore I'm not sure what to do. I want to stake my ADA for profits and security of the network but I don't want to lose them ofc. Any advice?

Thanks in advanced!"

3/4/2023,"Every Token on the Cardano chain has to be sent with some ADA with it (about 1.5) ((edit: Im not talking about the tx fee)). As far as i know its mainly a anti spam mechanism so people cant spam their token transactions? (correct me if im wrong) but wont that be a obstacle for Cardanos adoption? i was told this will also be neccesary on the Hydra chain so micropayments of tokens may require to send more ADA with it than the transaction is even valued. it makes things so much more complicated compared to other chains. even if the ammount of ADA required is reduced.. is this going to change at some point or will this be a inherent part of cardano?

&#x200B;

edit:

im not talking about the transaction fees. im talking about the ADA that has to be sent aditionally with the tokens and the transaction fees."
3/4/2023," I took a deep dive into Paima Studios!

Very exciting to imagine what this gaming engine can do for the future of gaming.

Let me know what you want to see next.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
3/3/2023,"Now that the Cardano DEFI ecosystem has finally started to boom: Liqwid Finance, Djed/Shen, Indigo Protocol, DEX's, etc., what DEFI strategies  (risky or not) are people starting to use ?"
3/4/2023,"A few different blockchains have ""gaming guilds"" for people interested in web3 games to share information between each other and help support gaming projects in their ecosystems. Additionally, there are many blockchain-independent gaming guilds as well

I was wondering, is there a Cardano Gaming Guild? I found one on Twitter, but it seems they never actually launched (dead website, no recent tweets). Cardano already has some games live (Paima Studios, SuperBull, Mocossi Planet) and seemingly multiple more in development, so it would make sense that there is some NPO to promote gaming on Cardano

Is anybody aware of such a group?"

26. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world. [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648)
27. Rumors are that other exchanges & stablecoin providers will receive letters outlining charges soon. One posted rumor is mentioning Circle (USDC) & Paxos specifically. [https://twitter.com/AP\_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322](https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322)
28. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem. [https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656](https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656)
29. Charles posted a reply to Brian Armstrong’s staking tweet that savagely highlights the regulatory problem with Ethereum’s custodial/slashing based staking. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1623530227870896130](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1623530227870896130)
30. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)
31. Now the SEC is going after Binance USD stablecoin issuer, Paxos. [https://archive.ph/nrgeU](https://archive.ph/nrgeU)
32. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano. [https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457](https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457)

34. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now. [https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-staking-services-are-not-securities-and-heres-why](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-staking-services-are-not-securities-and-heres-why)
35. The community is predictably conflicted about the possibility of contingent staking. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1624937015824510976](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1624937015824510976)
36. Here’s a fantastic thread by Sooraj explaining the huge innovative leap forward provided by Ouroboros Genesis for dynamic participation in proof-of-stake systems and making Cardano more secure than Ethereum or Algorand.

This is just the court saying that if all the factual allegations are taken as true, then there is a plausible claim for relief. This is not a ruling on the status of NFTs as securities or not. But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

3/2/2023,"**Cardano Tale: The Magical Adventure of the NFTs**

Once upon a time in a magical world, there lived a group of friends named Charles, Pi, Lukas, Tommy, Duncan, and Samuel. They loved exploring new things in their world, which was full of wonders and magic.

One day, they stumbled upon a treasure chest that was filled with sparkling cards. These cards were not ordinary cards, they were special, and each had a unique magical power. The cards were called NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens.

https://preview.redd.it/tiud65xl4dla1.png?width=1143&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f6cf6e033cc0ad674e831b386d91c399c099a847

The group of friends had never seen anything like it before. Charles, the leader of the group, knew that they had found something special. He explained to his friends that these cards were called NFTs and were very valuable.

Pi, the curious one, asked, ""Why are these cards so valuable? They look just like ordinary cards to me.""

Charles smiled and said, ""These cards are special because they are unique, and they cannot be duplicated. It's like having a one-of-a-kind treasure that no one else has.""

Lukas, the tech-savvy one, suggested they find out more about NFTs and their magical powers. So, they all went on a quest to learn more about NFTs.

On their journey, they met a wise old wizard named Tommy. He told them that NFTs were created using a magical technology called Cardano. The technology was so advanced that it allowed people to create unique digital assets, like the NFTs they had found.

https://preview.redd.it/ev8k7wsn4dla1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01aa3803210eb0886887c9affb98cff50b166022

Duncan, the brave one, asked, ""Can we create our own NFTs?""

Tommy nodded and said, ""Yes, you can! With the power of Cardano, you can create your own unique NFTs and add your own magical powers to them.""

Excited by the possibility of creating their own NFTs, the group of friends decided to use their creativity to make their own special NFTs. Samuel, the artist of the group, created a beautiful NFT with his magical paintbrush. Charles used his leadership skills to make a rare NFT, and Lukas used his tech skills to create a unique NFT that no one had ever seen before.

The friends were amazed by what they had accomplished. They had created their own magical NFTs and had learned about the power of Cardano. They were grateful for their adventure and couldn't wait to see what other magical things they could create using their newfound knowledge.

And from that day on, the group of friends continued to explore the wonders of their magical world and all the exciting things they could do with NFTs and Cardano technology.

3/2/2023,"ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. Within 5 days, 1 million users had tried the app. In two months, it had more than 100 million users. That's a new world record for how quickly people adopted the service. 13 million people use the app every day. Converted to TPS, that would be 150. AI is used by about 50 times more people per day than Bitcoin. New startups are emerging literally every day and want to use AI for their business. It is almost certain that AI will change the world within the next decade. Wait, didn't they say the same thing about blockchain? Why is blockchain adoption so slow compared to ChatGPT? If you look into history, you will find that AI and blockchain have roots in the distant past. Cardano can be considered a publicly available solution, with decades of development behind each technology that is used. It's good to know that if a killer application emerges, the world can adopt it very quickly. Just as AI is celebrating mass success with ChatGPT, the blockchain industry is sure to succeed. We just need to keep on developing technology and finding applications. Come see what AI and blockchain have in common in terms of technology development and what that could mean for Cardano.

# TLDR

* People believe that the history of blockchain projects dates back to the time of their launch. These projects use technologies that are much older.
* The AI industry had to go through an ""AI winter"" lasting more than a decade. The blockchain industry may experience a “crypto winter” before it succeeds. 
* The evolution of the blockchain industry has certainly not stopped with the launch of Bitcoin. Smart contracts, tokenization, PoS, and decentralized governance are all things that came after Bitcoin.
* We are waiting for ChatGPT of the blockchain industry.
* Bitcoin is not the first attempt to create a cryptocurrency. It's hard to imagine it being the last possible attempt.
* The idea of a decentralized global computer is sound and if Cardano fails people will make another attempt. But Cardano is still at the beginning, so it's a successful project so far.

# The history of AI will help us understand the blockchain industry

It may surprise you to know that AI technology has its roots in the 1950s and it has been used in industry for decades. ChatGPT is only the first publicly available app that has succeeded en masse. Take a look at how AI has evolved and what the industry has had to go through to the present day where we can use it for our own purposes for free. The modern concept of AI emerged in the 1950s with the development of computers and the theory of computation. Mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing proposed the ""Turing Test"" in 1950, which became a fundamental concept in AI research.

3/2/2023,"The emergence of Web3 technologies presents an opportunity to shift organisational structures towards more cooperative governance models. A platform that allows projects to launch decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) quickly has been developed, which is known as Summon. The platform is based on Cardano’s Plutus-Core technology and a strong understanding of off-chain code to enable decentralised coordination and governance."

26. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world. [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648)

28. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem. [https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656](https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656)

30. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)
31. Now the SEC is going after Binance USD stablecoin issuer, Paxos. [https://archive.ph/nrgeU](https://archive.ph/nrgeU)
32. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano.

34. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now. [https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-staking-services-are-not-securities-and-heres-why](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-staking-services-are-not-securities-and-heres-why)
35. The community is predictably conflicted about the possibility of contingent staking. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1624937015824510976](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1624937015824510976)
36. Here’s a fantastic thread by Sooraj explaining the huge innovative leap forward provided by Ouroboros Genesis for dynamic participation in proof-of-stake systems and making Cardano more secure than Ethereum or Algorand.

42. The messaging against the energy use in Bitcoin is fully ramping up now courtesy of Bloomberg and the Harold and Kumar guy.

81. In the class action suit against Dapper Labs (creators of CryptoKitties) alleging the NBA Top Shot Moments NFTs are securities, the court has denied the motion to dismiss. This is just the court saying that if all the factual allegations are taken as true, then there is a plausible claim for relief. This is not a ruling on the status of NFTs as securities or not. But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

If you're interested in the Cardano blockchain network, I want to share a helpful resource with you. Scortik, a review and rating platform for blockchain protocols, has recently published a comprehensive review and rating of Cardano, which is available at [https://scortik.com/cardano](https://scortik.com/cardano).

We are constantly testing and refining our platform to provide accurate and unbiased information, and we value feedback from the community. Please review our Cardano rating and let us know if there are any errors or if we missed any important information.

I am representing Scortik, and we are here to listen and learn from the community. Thank you for taking the time to review our Cardano rating, and we appreciate any feedback you can provide.

3/1/2023,"Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of fiat money issued by a central bank. We believe you have all heard of this phenomenon. Many central banks around the world are in the research phase, development phase, or have completed their first pilot programs. CBDCs are even already in use in three countries and their number will almost certainly grow in the coming years. Some experts warn that CBDC poses risks associated with loss of privacy, or it may even be a tool for governments to control residents. Why should people adopt CBDC in the first place? Wouldn't we be better off using stablecoins on Cardano? To know the answers, we need to look at why central banks are working on CBDCs. Let's compare CBDC with stablecoins on Cardano. Can these two technologies coexist?

# TLDR

* CBDCs can be tokenized similarly to USD-backed stablecoins.
* It is not necessary to look at CBDC and blockchain as two competing solutions but as complementary networks.
* The CBDC effectively suppresses the right to privacy as well as the right to possess value. Transactions through the Cardano ecosystem can be private and you can own the value.
* Central banks can retain full control over monetary policy while giving people the freedom to choose what specific networks to use.
* CBDC tokenization will allow the separation of the needs of central banks from the right to privacy and self-custody.
* Central banks could mint at least part of the CBDC on SC platforms to make it easier for people to access.

3/1/2023,"Hi, is there a better way to move assets from Etherium to Cardarno?
Currently looking at Nomad but have to complete KYC.
Would prefer to not have to complete KYC .
Most other chains can move assets to and from each other quite easily.
I believe that this stifles adoption for Cardarno.
I really like what Cardarno stands for as well as their approach to development. But this is a fair criticism of Cardarno at the moment.

Thanks."

25. Looks like Kraken was the first staking target of the SEC. [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25)
26. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world. [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648)
27. Rumors are that other exchanges & stablecoin providers will receive letters outlining charges soon. One posted rumor is mentioning Circle (USDC) & Paxos specifically. [https://twitter.com/AP\_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322](https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322)
28. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem. [https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656](https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656)
29. Charles posted a reply to Brian Armstrong’s staking tweet that savagely highlights the regulatory problem with Ethereum’s custodial/slashing based staking. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1623530227870896130](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1623530227870896130)
30. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)
31. Now the SEC is going after Binance USD stablecoin issuer, Paxos. [https://archive.ph/nrgeU](https://archive.ph/nrgeU)
32. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano. [https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457](https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457)

34. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now. [https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-staking-services-are-not-securities-and-heres-why](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-staking-services-are-not-securities-and-heres-why)

36. Here’s a fantastic thread by Sooraj explaining the huge innovative leap forward provided by Ouroboros Genesis for dynamic participation in proof-of-stake systems and making Cardano more secure than Ethereum or Algorand. This is by far the best explanation I’ve seen. [https://twitter.com/Soorajksaju2/status/1623748877152034818](https://twitter.com/Soorajksaju2/status/1623748877152034818)

42. The messaging against the energy use in Bitcoin is fully ramping up now courtesy of Bloomberg and the Harold and Kumar guy. Knowing that this would happen was a part of choosing proof-of-stake and Cardano for many of us.

47. Higher than expected US inflation numbers were released today (Feb 14) with the CPI up 6.4% from a year ago. [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/14/consumer-price-index-january-2023-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/14/consumer-price-index-january-2023-.html)

50. This one is calling it a “midnight massacre” where Gensler will bring as many enforcement actions as possible before the new congress gets its bearings. [https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1623796900586573826](https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1623796900586573826)

61. My condolences to those of you who recently lost your AI girlfriend. Maybe all the free time is the cause of the recent price spike in ADA.

63. SEC Do Kwon complaint alleges that Luna,UST, MIR, & wLuna are all securities. At this point, I think we can assume the SEC will be happy to call any crypto a security if they are trying to go after you.

81. In the class action suit against Dapper Labs (creators of CryptoKitties) alleging the NBA Top Shot Moments NFTs are securities, the court has denied the motion to dismiss. This is just the court saying that if all the factual allegations are taken as true, then there is a plausible claim for relief. This is not a ruling on the status of NFTs as securities or not. But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

90. Some are raising concerns Base may be a colossal mistake since Coinbase is the only major SEC regulated crypto company and there could be many different tokens the SEC considers securities and many types of DeFi transaction traversing this L2, this could accelerate regulatory pressure on centralized L2s as broker/dealers.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
2/28/2023,"Every Cardano supporter knows that there will only be 45,000,000,000 ADA coins. ADA is a scarce resource. For many, it is a store of value or the money of the future. The immutability of monetary policy is a fundamental principle for any blockchain. If it were to be violated, it would have fatal consequences on people's trust in the project. There is a direct link between scarcity and blockchain security. The market value of coins determines the quality of blockchain security. If security starts to decline, a change in monetary policy may be necessary as one possible solution. The choice between security or scarcity is a dilemma that would be very uncomfortable for the community. Is it possible to have a long-term economically sustainable blockchain without having to change scarcity? What mechanisms prevent a change in the monetary system and why is governance important? 

# TLDR

* Monetary rules can exist forever, no matter what technology is used to enforce and maintain them. 
* In order of importance, rules come first, community second, and technology third.
* Maintaining scarcity essentially means making a key decision in times of crisis and changing the protocol in time.
* Scarcity can only be sustained economically in the long run through a sufficient security budget.
* Those who are able to manage resources more efficiently have a better chance of survival.
* The choice between scarcity and security is a choice that the community does not want to have, as they may not agree on a solution.
* All ADA holders together are responsible for both security and scarcity.

# How to maintain scarcity?

Change is the only constant we can completely rely on in our universe. This is doubly true for technological progress. Blockchain protocols have the ambition to exist for several decades, perhaps forever. People are not interested in a particular protocol in terms of its design, implementation, or technological maturity, but mainly because of the financial and social opportunity it brings. They want monetary policy, decentralization and its associated features, protocol security, the ability to connect people without third parties, etc. to remain unchanged. Unfortunately, this cannot (very likely) be achieved without changing the protocols and their specific properties. Negative developments may force a change in rules that were intended to remain unchanged forever. To ensure the security of the protocol, it may be necessary to change monetary policy.

2/28/2023,"Just curious if somebody can assist me in doing so I have about 150 tokens locked and would like to free them up. I've been collecting tokens from drip drops for ever and I have a feeling it has something to do with this. 

My main ADA account is linked to ledger I also have a Daedalus wallet as well, I was gonna try to send all the tokens other than my main tokens I like ADA,WMT,MELD,C3,Etc from my ledger to Daedalus would this do it?"

Pulsar Finance is about to launch on Cardano. To do some final tests they are looking for some Cardano testers.  


Pulsar Finance, allows you to track all your assets in one single place, from Tokens, Defi positions (farm, LPs, debt) and NFTs. They have already added support for over 40 Cosmos chains, TRON, NEAR and Aurora and will now be adding support for Cardano. You can see what they have done so for for other ecosystems here: pulsar.finance  


Therefore they are looking to find Cardano users to test their Alpha version before they go live in the next couple of days.

26. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world.

28. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem.

32. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano.

34. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

2/27/2023,"Just a post to ask if anyone else has ever looked at there balance on Yoroi one day and see XXXX.XX amount then the next that amount has went up by roughly 500 ada. Checking the transaction logs the only transactions in the last 4 months are for DripDropz 4 to 5 ada sent and roughly 2.5 returned with assets. Is this just an error on Yoroi's behalf? Where did this ghost ADA come from?

2/27/2023,"Some may mistakenly think that if you want to write smart contracts for Cardano you have to learn Haskell. You can go that route, or use one of the emerging alternatives. One of these is Aiken, a new programming language and toolkit for developing smart contracts on Cardano. Aiken will be a full-featured platform that allows you to write a smart contract quickly including detailed error messages and conveniently with all the necessary tools.

**TLDR**

* Aiken focuses only on the on-chain part of the application.
* Aiken will allow you to write and run the ""Hello, World!"" app in 10 minutes.
* The on-chain part of the application can be written in any language as long as there is a compiler that translates the code into Plutus Core.
* The compiler works similarly to a language translator.
* An Alpha release with the first pioneers is scheduled for Q1 2023.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

40. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world. [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648)

42. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem.

44. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)

46. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano.

48. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

50. Here’s a fantastic thread by Sooraj explaining the huge innovative leap forward provided by Ouroboros Genesis for dynamic participation in proof-of-stake systems and making Cardano more secure than Ethereum or Algorand.

95. In the class action suit against Dapper Labs (creators of CryptoKitties) alleging the NBA Top Shot Moments NFTs are securities, the court has denied the motion to dismiss. This is just the court saying that if all the factual allegations are taken as true, then there is a plausible claim for relief.  This is not a ruling on the status of NFTs as securities or not. But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

103. The Coinbase blue ball mystery is a project named Base and is an ETH L2 that will operate initially as a centralized optimistic rollup that may progressively become more decentralized.

104. Some are raising concerns Base may be a colossal mistake since Coinbase is the only major SEC regulated crypto company and there could be many different tokens the SEC considers securities and many types of DeFi transaction traversing this L2, this could accelerate regulatory pressure on centralized L2s as broker/dealers.

2/27/2023,"hello-

i like to move my ADA. but is there a better way than:

1. claiming rewards
2. moving ALL away.
3. sending in new ADA 4 weeks later for GAS
4. collecting the new rewards, which were delayed given and added to the live stake, generating itself new rewards
5. go to/repeat 2. until the -new/new/new ... rewards are small enough you dont care..or GAS is higher than rescue amount

?

\-thx

\--------------------------------------update

i wasnt downvoting anyone. i just got back and am amazed about the constructional help in my first cardano subreddit i find here.

although i never ever got so many harmful chatbots for a post, too. nine friendly bots f$%#@ want me to syncronize my wallet...

&#x200B;"
2/26/2023,"Took a deep dive into SingularityNET

Very exciting to find out what this project aims to achieve.

Let me know what you want to see next.

Any other Cardano Dex you’d recommend?

Yes, I did find https://www.cardanocube.io/collections/exchanges-dex

Minswap supports ledger directly.  So currently using them (even though I’ve seen slightly better prices on SundaeSwap for tokens I’m interested in)."
2/27/2023,"Good morning , Can you give some information , a while ago i wanted to withdraw my money from deadalus to put it on binance. the customer service asked me to pay 4% of my assets to be able to withdraw the money as i did not have all the funds my wife to send some of the money asking the customer service of deadalus if she could. today deadalus said that we had no right because I for my part did not report it and that it is considered money laundering. and asks me to pay an 8% penalty but I don't have the funds yet. I ask for a delay but want me to pay in 5 days, or he donates my assets to charities. can you help me. THANKS"
2/26/2023,"I'm a bit worried because Cardano is running in the opposite direction to the actual crypto technologhy. 

I mean, scalability solutions via L2 (zk rollups / optimistic roll ups) are being deployed and seems the future, and Cardano is focused on Sidechains or Hydra (ok, its a L2 but not a zk or optimistic, its a channel state L2 and seems that could be technologically worse than Ethereum's L2).

We have been happy being an ""alt"" techically better than competitors, but seems that we're losing the technology battle. 

Charles Hoskinson says that L2 solutions based on rollups will be in Cardano in the future but.....

When? Is anyone working on it? 

Another key point, if Cardano wants to have big L2 solutions, it has to work in solving the ""data availability"" layer (Ethereum is working on it with the proto-danksharking solution).

This is a no FUD post, but seems like Haskell devs as Sebastian Guillemot (Milkomeda) are pointing that problem and Cardano could be ""obsolete"" in 2/3 years if they dont open its ecosystem to L2."
2/26/2023,"I put some test funds into another yoroi. Delegated them.

Added the rest from exchange today. Do I not need to delegate the rest? As in the wallet itself adds the funds to pre-designated delegation?

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
2/25/2023,"This doc states that in each epoch the inflation is 0.3% of the reserves, with 20% going to the Treasury: https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/monetary-policy

Cexplorer states the reserves have ~9.48bi ADAs now:
https://cexplorer.io/pot

This should mean 0.3%*9.48bi of rewards per epoch, or ~28.44M, right?

If we're talking about 28.44M, that means 22,75M for delegators and ~5,68M for Treasury

The same chart (and I double checked at Cardano Blockchain Insights) shows us that the Treasury is actually receiving something around 5,68M and that’s ok.

But if you check this chart again you will see that the reserves are being reduced by ~18M each epoch (decreasing each epoch, of course).

I've checked several previous epochs by looking at data from Cexplorer, Cardano Blockchain Insights and Cardanoscan, but it seems to me that delegators are getting ~10M less ADAs than they should. Or else the documentation is outdated and now the issuance is lower and Treasury gets ~30%?

What am I missing?"

2/24/2023,I've been skimming for information on when the Fund10 catalyst vote is. Can't find anything. Does anyone know when it'll be?
2/24/2023,"They are a great innovation that allows smaller pools to get delegation and start minting blocks, while delegators gain some extra yield and contribute to decentralizing Cardano. 

But besides that, there are many other products they are developing that allow users to get passive income, and support businesses to grow and develop.

Hello there, beautiful soul!  


Hope this message finds you well.  


Living in the Cardano ecosystem often feels like time travel. You blink - and there it goes. One week flies by. In that sense, it also means that it was another week of building, educating, and participating in the collective shaping of how Cardano looks like.   


This week, during town hall we've seen great presentations from [DLT 360 team and their industry onboarding efforts](https://www.youtube.com/live/MFpdUUjwZBE?feature=share&t=412), [building dApps with Python](https://www.youtube.com/live/MFpdUUjwZBE?feature=share&t=1538), [Chinese community building with Dumpling](https://www.youtube.com/live/MFpdUUjwZBE?feature=share&t=1958), or [this amazing agreements-building platform - Consenz.](https://www.youtube.com/live/MFpdUUjwZBE?feature=share&t=2200) The ingenuity and hard work of Catalyst is shining through and we wish all the best of luck to these projects in the coming weeks and months. Well done.   


The Catalyst team also shared a quick update during this month's Cardano 360 show and you can catch [the timestamped segment here](https://youtu.be/J2UdDtqziF4?t=385). Topics? Current progress and call to action to start registering for the upcoming Special Voting Event. More details will be shared soon as well.  


I also recommend reviewing community-led governance conversations around [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380) and [Voltaire](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/) more broadly. Learn more about these further below in the '*Governance front and center'* section.

Catalyst Circle is working diligently to formalize its next steps and set the firm direction and the north star for its engagement within the ecosystem. There are so many directions and needs that require attention. [Lloyd Duhan](https://twitter.com/radioastro) offered to hold a special training session this week to help navigate these decisions with all the Circle members. The Circle will be sharing soon their insights with you.  


Thank you Lloyd for your leadership and willingness to help this amazing group of individuals in their pursuit of navigating the Catalyst ecosystem.

Stephanie King of Lido Nation [has shared a great milestone achievement](https://www.lidonation.com/en/posts/introducing-catalyst-explorer) from their recently funded project to build a community tool to help with resurfacing data insights in a humanly readable manner. In her words  


""The data behind the amazing numbers in Project Catalyst - the people, the projects, the results - have always been hypothetically public. However, actually accessing and understanding it has always been difficult. If you could manage to track down one of the many, it was still up to you to click through the many tabs and rows of raw data.""

# Governance front and center

Last week, a community-led roundtable took place on [the topic of CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380). Maybe you ask, CIP what? CIPs - commonly known as Cardano Improvements Proposals - is a framework with which the community can formally put forth a proposal for an improvement for review in the ecosystem. You can learn about these more in the section further below that summarizes weekly updates from the CIP world.  


Circling back to [the CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380) community workshop - as [Zoe from Swarm ](https://twitter.com/AnimaValeska)reviews:  


""First, in the plenum, we discussed what the CIP process actually is and how it works. We then distributed ourselves into breakout rooms on the topics of dReps, Constitutional committee, SPOs, and inclusivity/accessibility of specific communication and information.""  


""During the wrap-up, we discussed some further broad governance questions; and after the “official” (more or less lol) session we also raised and collected more concerns. Overall, it has been a very broad and rich discussion on all things Voltaire! Lastly, we collectively collected points raised as good as possible [as sticky notes on the following Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPv2UmUI=/).""  


You can get the full recording of this session [via this youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Xhzgta1xk). Also recommended some additional perspectives from these videos:

* [Army of Spies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWFZYgmiAg); [Jspeak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXM1Pxd0hgQ); [QA DAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe9XvezpdbI); [Voltaire Discussions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiLhhOVXQOg); [Exploring Dynamic Governance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfAUD4rNFJs)
* **Not sure how GitHub can be used?** [**This video**](https://youtu.be/BmdddVHjCX0) **will help you.**

On a related theme, next week, a number of SPOs and developers (including some from the Catalyst community) will attend a focused technical workshop in Colorado (run by the Cardano Foundation and IOG) to review the mechanics of CIP 1694, the first in a number of community consultations planned for this year.  


Full meeting minutes will be published after the event for further community engagement and feedback. If you wish to add your perspectives to CIP 1694, you can find it [here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380).  


Make sure you add your voice as the era of Voltaire rolls out!

Last week, we announced the Funded Project Workshops on technical and business growth topics focused on empowering project owners funded by Catalyst. The goal is to develop the skills and the right frameworks to complete their projects and be successful in the ecosystem.  


This week, the funded projects had the first of these workshops, titled: **Business Models for Disruptive Emerging Tech Businesses** presented by Harry Hellyer from Edify Collabs. The session focused on finding the best ways to express the value created by your team, its products, and services — to yourselves, your customers, partners, and investors.  


Fundamentally, the funded projects present during the session went through an exercise to get under the hood of their value propositions and identify the value they bring and the ecosystems it is best suited for.  


For more on the session, check out the video recording here: [https://bit.ly/3XQ4IBm](https://bit.ly/3XQ4IBm)  


Expect more funded project workshops in the coming weeks as we aim to provide more education and resources for projects building in the Catalyst ecosystem throughout the rest of the year. These workshops are going to be made available soon via Catalyst YouTube Playlist as well.

# Last week in CIPs 

https://preview.redd.it/ckxpjcnb07ka1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c66e9cbee7366deef813e5fc4d9094f3acfabcfe

Here's the recap from my colleague [Ryan Williams](https://twitter.com/Ryun1_) that writes these fantastic CIP round-ups. I figured you'd like them, too. So here's the latest to get up to speed. You can catch past and future summaries [via this Cardano forum thread here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/what-happened-in-cips-last-week/109101) as well. If are unsure what CIPs are about - please check out this link to dive deeper: [https://cips.cardano.org/](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). 

**RW:** What happened in CIPs last week?

* [CIP-???? | Extendable dApp Connector](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/462) **\[New Proposal\]**:
   * This CIP proposes an alternative to CIP-30 for a *base* dApp-Wallet communication bridge whilst adding a scheme for how functionality can be enhanced.
   * I (Ryan) am an author of this 

**RW:** Continued Recommendations:

* [CIP-0057? | Plutus Smart-Contract Blueprints](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/258)
   * This proposal specifies a language for documenting Plutus contracts in a machine-readable manner. This is akin to what [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification) or [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.4.0) are for, documenting HTTP services and asynchronous services respectively.
   * Lots of recent discussions here too.
* [CIP-0086? | NFT Metadata Update Oracles](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/430)
   * This proposal extends the [CIP-25](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0025) standard for defining and updating token metadata via transaction metadata, by providing a new mechanism to update token metadata without having to mint or burn tokens.
   * Interesting proposal for updating NFT (or another asset) metadata.

**Next Meeting:**

* CIP Editors Meeting #62 (next Tuesday):
   * Feb 28th 9:30am UTC.
* Held on Discord - [here](https://discord.gg/4yukWV3khD).
* Agenda TBD.

Further varied governance and Catalyst community conversations can be also followed on [the official Cardano forum here](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). Don't be shy to be part of the conversation. 

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

https://preview.redd.it/uhi97urd07ka1.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5129a1bac3c6c789283827932a4896afda4c892a

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems. The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

Let’s go….

Newly Covered Today:

1. Jpg.store is hinting at $jpg. [https://twitter.com/jpgstoreNFT/status/1628861350255505412](https://twitter.com/jpgstoreNFT/status/1628861350255505412)

5. Sadly, Shareslake, the project behind the first native stablecoin on Cardano is also calling it quits due to lack of traction. [https://twitter.com/Shareslake/status/1628787547210936322](https://twitter.com/Shareslake/status/1628787547210936322) 
6. The Coinbase blue ball mystery is a project named Base and is an ETH L2 that will operate initially as a centralized optimistic rollup that may progressively become more decentralized. [https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1628760201254903809](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1628760201254903809) 
7. Some are raising concerns Base may be a colossal mistake since Coinbase is the only major SEC regulated crypto company and there could be many different tokens the SEC considers securities and many types of DeFi transaction traversing this L2, this could accelerate regulatory pressure on centralized L2s as broker/dealers. [https://twitter.com/lex\_node/status/1628787075515396098](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1628787075515396098)

3.

21. Having watched Martin throughout the '90s and Bad Boys (about a million times), it's surreal & amazing to see that the content is interesting to a guy who entertained me so much. Thank you immensely! [https://twitter.com/realmartymar/status/1622710686647287808](https://twitter.com/realmartymar/status/1622710686647287808)

[https://twitter.com/StakeWithPride/status/1623064762610499586](https://twitter.com/StakeWithPride/status/1623064762610499586)

33. Unsurprisingly, the crypto crackdown that was long predicted for after the mid-term elections is also taking place via banking access (once again). [https://twitter.com/AP\_Abacus/status/1623346563069116417](https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1623346563069116417)
34. Nice try, Coin Center! The real difference is between custodial staking and non-custodial staking. [https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1623469303545593856](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1623469303545593856)

36. The UK has released a consultation paper on plans for the Digital Pound saying “it is likely” to be needed. [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/1134845/CBDC\_WEB\_PDF\_-\_7\_FEB\_2023\_1130am.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1134845/CBDC_WEB_PDF_-_7_FEB_2023_1130am.pdf)
37. Apparently, you can now invite the public to come check out your Cardano Island Crib. [https://twitter.com/VirtuaMetaverse/status/1623365199032946697](https://twitter.com/VirtuaMetaverse/status/1623365199032946697)
38. Get ready for lots of Cardano essays. Twitter Blue people now have 4k characters. [https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1623411400545632256](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1623411400545632256)
39. Looks like Kraken was the first staking target of the SEC. [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25)
40. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world. [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648)
41. Rumors are that other exchanges & stablecoin providers will receive letters outlining charges soon. One posted rumor is mentioning Circle (USDC) & Paxos specifically. [https://twitter.com/AP\_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322](https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322)
42. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem. [https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656](https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656)
43. Charles posted a reply to Brian Armstrong’s staking tweet that savagely highlights the regulatory problem with Ethereum’s custodial/slashing based staking. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1623530227870896130](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1623530227870896130)
44. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)
45. Now the SEC is going after Binance USD stablecoin issuer, Paxos. [https://archive.ph/nrgeU](https://archive.ph/nrgeU)
46. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano. [https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457](https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457)
47. Here’s the actual complaint in the Kraken/SEC settlement. [https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-25.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-25.pdf)
48. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now. [https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-staking-services-are-not-securities-and-heres-why](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-staking-services-are-not-securities-and-heres-why)
49. The community is predictably conflicted about the possibility of contingent staking. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1624937015824510976](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1624937015824510976)
50. Here’s a fantastic thread by Sooraj explaining the huge innovative leap forward provided by Ouroboros Genesis for dynamic participation in proof-of-stake systems and making Cardano more secure than Ethereum or Algorand. This is by far the best explanation I’ve seen. [https://twitter.com/Soorajksaju2/status/1623748877152034818](https://twitter.com/Soorajksaju2/status/1623748877152034818)
51. FutureFest obviously understands the importance of proximity audio chat in virtual worlds. [https://twitter.com/coc\_space/status/1623759580017614848](https://twitter.com/coc_space/status/1623759580017614848)

2/24/2023,"Cardano, a blockchain platform, has a strong commitment to decentralization as one of its core principles. The platform’s decentralization is divided into three pillars: networking, governance, and block production. Currently, Cardano has achieved complete decentralization in block production, and the next step is the complete decentralization of the networking layer."

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"

40. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world.

42. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem.

44. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)
45. Now the SEC is going after Binance USD stablecoin issuer, Paxos. [https://archive.ph/nrgeU](https://archive.ph/nrgeU)
46. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano.

48. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

56. The messaging against the energy use in Bitcoin is fully ramping up now courtesy of Bloomberg and the Harold and Kumar guy.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
2/23/2023,"During the debate on Contingent Staking, an interesting point was made that stakers are customers of staking pools. Is this really the case? Let's use this question to explain the basic principles of economic incentives and the rewarding mechanism in staking. This allows us to find out who is running what business and who the customer is. 

# TLDR

* Delegating ADA coins is a similar mechanism to voting in a democratic election. 
* Stakers delegate coins to the pool and continue to have full control over the coins. 
* Cardano can be perceived as an employer paying for the services of its employees.
* Both SPOs and stakers are running a business.
* SPOs are active participants when it comes to the production of blocks, while stakers are passive ones.
* Stakers are probably something like co-owners or shareholders of pools.
* If a Lovelace is delegated to a pool, this means that the pool mints the block on behalf of the staker.

# Who's the customer? 

Customers usually buy something and get something in return. In order for customers to buy something, they need to choose a merchant to satisfy their demand. There is a business between the merchant and the customer. They both profit. The customer gets what they need and the merchant makes a margin on the sale. This is not the case with staking. Stakers do not buy a service from SPOs and do not pay them anything. They only voluntarily delegate ADA coins to pools, thus increasing the total stake of the pools. With delegated coins, pools can mint a larger number of blocks. For this, both SPOs and stakers will receive rewards from the Cardano protocol.

2/23/2023,"Crypto is revolutionary from it's inception, by design.

The block-chain projects who open the flood gates to regulations, restrictions, censorship, social credit scores, and Government over-reach can ""Not"" claim to be decentralized. They have become a Government puppet.

Anyone who thinks we should abandon our core values in an attempt to gain Government favor and mass adoption will be lambs led to the slaughter. 

Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Privacy is enshrined in the Constitution. Yet on every occasion the Government has circumvented these rights by cleaver and devious means.

In the State of Illinois, Senator Robert Peters introduced a bill under the Digital Property Protection and Law Enforcement Act..
Section 15 (b) of SB1887 states:

“A blockchain network that processes a blockchain transaction originating in this State at any time after the effective date of this Act shall process a court-ordered blockchain transaction without the need for the private key associated with the digital property or smart contract.”

The defaulters of the law will face a civil penalty of up to $10,000.

Self Sovereign Identity is new speak for KYC. 

Would self sovereign identity prevent Governments from ""Sanctioning"" peaceful protestors? No it would not! It would actually assist tyrannical governments in financial censorship. Any Block-Chain Crypto that censors, freezes or block wallets transactions at the request of the State is not ""Decentralized"" and will be more akin to a CBDC than real Crypto.

We must embrace dangerous decentralized freedom or we will lose that freedom and become slaves to malicious compliance."
2/22/2023,"Staking on centralized exchanges is very disadvantageous for coin owners. They bear most of the risk associated with the loss of coins and let third parties profit. Yet the exchanges carry minimal risk and the CEO may decide to handle the coins differently than promised. With the advent of regulation, particularly in the US, Staking-as-a-Service (SaaS), provided by exchanges, is becoming more problematic. People should understand that ADA coins are the key to decentralizing Cardano. The project is deliberately designed so that people do not need unnecessary and unreliable intermediaries for financial transactions. It is not even necessary to rely on regulators and laws for staking. Staking is a financial operation. It should ideally be a Peer-to-Peer business between a staking pool operator (SPO) and a delegator. Believe that in the past CeFi services went bankrupt while DeFi and the protocols worked exactly as they had written in their source code. Let's take a look at the biggest differences between using a SaaS service and delegating ADA coins from your own wallet.

# TLDR

* The design of the protocol is deliberately devised to allow it to support its own needs as well as the needs of stakers and SPOs.
* ADA holders that stake coins on centralized exchanges give up control not only of the coins but also of the Cardano network.
* Regulators are tasked with protecting the assets of people who entrust them to a third party. ADA holders don't need third parties for staking.
* ADA holders should realize that if there is any attack on Cardano through the exchanges, they will be the ones who lose their property.
* The ADA holder decides what pool they delegate to, can vote in Catalyst, can participate in ISPO, can use DeFi, and can spend coins at any time.
* Exchanges only ever do what is profitable for their own business and have no economic interest in supporting the Cardano ecosystem. ADA holders can support the ecosystem.

2/22/2023,"Simple earn is no longer allowed in Australia on binance (locked / flexible staking). Doesnt look like ADA is available for defi on binance either.

Australian users - are you aware of any other ways to earn or am I just bag holding a static pile of constantly devaluing ADA?

Staking was the only thing keeping me in the game - at least it offered an opportunity to increase my holding to recover the crippling losses. At a total loss as to what the point of holding this bag of nothing is right now."

48. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
2/22/2023,Is there any bridge yet?
2/21/2023,"The Cardano community should be proud of the debate around Contingent Staking (CS). Whatever your opinion on this functionality, the important thing is that it is openly debated by such a large number of people. The debate has its problems and the arguments are not always based on facts. Many opinions are driven by fear or lack of technical knowledge about how blockchain works. You can't say that anyone is moderating the debate, although Charles Hoskinson is setting the main tone. The community is divided. One part defends CS, and the other sees it as a road to hell. At the moment, there is not even a CIP on CS and yet the debate is happening, which we consider a great success. It reminds me of the times when the Bitcoin community was debating block size, or the OP\_Return wars were going on. We believe that the future of the Cardano project will depend mainly on the quality of decentralized governance. Let's take a step back and think about what decentralization is really about. 

# TLDR

* People mistakenly consider the immutability of protocol rules to be the point of decentralization. 
* A decentralized system must be capable of change through democratic voting.
* The ability to vote in a decentralized way is perhaps more important than network consensus.
* What should be immutable is the mission of the project. Specific protocol rules can be modified if it helps achieve the mission.
* Conflict of views is a perfectly natural manifestation in a democratic society. Why should it be different in the context of blockchain?
* More important than the specific principles of blockchain technology is trust in the system. 
* Voting is a way to keep the community together and overcome disputes. 

# Ability to evolve

People sometimes think that all the rules about how a distributed network works can be put into the source code. They then consider these rules to be immutable, i.e. forever given or binding. People tend to protect these rules and insist on their immutability. They believe that this will ensure the long-term existence of the project. They see this as the point of decentralization. It is a perfectly logical attitude. But I'm afraid it doesn't necessarily work well in a dynamic world that is full of change. In nature, the individuals that survive longest are those that can adapt to new conditions as quickly and efficiently as possible. I believe that this principle is ubiquitous and applies to the functioning of society and, by extension, to technology.

Furthermore, we dive deeper into Phase 2 of the project, and all the changes it brought into the roadmap, the vision, and the tokenomics!"
2/21/2023,"Hi all! I was under the impression that the original plan was to increase k more than a year ago. There are so many small pool that fight for survival but at the same time are needed for decentralization. What's the downside of just raising k to a 1000 or even more? I guess those running multiple will lose a bit but honestly, those with 2 or more pools filled up have made already soooo much profit as far as I can tell...why not just increase k? What's the downside?"
2/21/2023,"Looking for a high level description of current capabilities of Cardano Dex’s. 

I am specifically interested in if using any of the Cardano Dex’s could replace how I have used a platform like Nexo. I typically would transfer ADA to Nexo, borrow USD by posting collateral (in ADA) and have it deposited in my bank account. I would then repay the loan in ADA when I was ready. 

If possible, provide a workflow for borrowing an asset to converting to fiat, concluding with repaying said asset. 

I want to use the Dex’s available on Cardano instead of Nexo. Is this possible? Thanks in advance!!"

39. Looks like Kraken was the first staking target of the SEC. [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25)
40. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world. [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648)
41. Rumors are that other exchanges & stablecoin providers will receive letters outlining charges soon. One posted rumor is mentioning Circle (USDC) & Paxos specifically. [https://twitter.com/AP\_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322](https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322)
42. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem. [https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656](https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656)
43. Charles posted a reply to Brian Armstrong’s staking tweet that savagely highlights the regulatory problem with Ethereum’s custodial/slashing based staking. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1623530227870896130](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1623530227870896130)
44. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)
45. Now the SEC is going after Binance USD stablecoin issuer, Paxos. [https://archive.ph/nrgeU](https://archive.ph/nrgeU)
46. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano. [https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457](https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457)

48. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

50. Here’s a fantastic thread by Sooraj explaining the huge innovative leap forward provided by Ouroboros Genesis for dynamic participation in proof-of-stake systems and making Cardano more secure than Ethereum or Algorand.

56. The messaging against the energy use in Bitcoin is fully ramping up now courtesy of Bloomberg and the Harold and Kumar guy. Knowing that this would happen was a part of choosing proof-of-stake and Cardano for many of us.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
2/21/2023,"Let’s talk voting rights. What’s to prevent ADA denominated quantity manipulating the governance system? 

If DIDs and KYC aren’t involved how is one wallet going to carry any substantial meaning? 

On average we vote with our financial interest. 

Cardano looks at risk of becoming a legacy governance system with new buttons. 

Not to mention our consensus mechanism is controlled by rich SPOs exclusively. 

The egalitarian ethos of the cardano vision appears highly dubious. I’m bullish on the price but not the value. 

The uphill struggle for equality isn’t going to amount to anything if our governance is prone to manipulation and self interest of the already powerful. 

One wallet, one human, trust less without regulation appears impossible. Thoughts?"
2/21/2023,When will Shen Holder rewards be airdropped into wallets?
2/20/2023,"Why two different wallets? It is because one is extremely user-friendly, the other is moblie friendly and the last one is extremely in-depth and has pretty much everything to offer. 

**Nami - The User Friendly** 

This wallet is the cleanest and most user-freindly one to use on any PC. The UI is clean and very straight forward. This is definitely the one I use the most and one which I would refer to a great hot wallet.

**Flint - The Mobile Experience**

Flint has the best mobile experiences hands down. Nothing come close to it. You can use any dApp with flint without any issues. It is really designed in a way for mobile use. I personally do not like to use my crypto when I am out and about but for those of you that do, this would give you the best expereiecnes. 

**Eternl - The Most In-Depth** 

This wallet has it all, whatever setting and options you are thinking about it has it all. One of my favourite funtion is to have multiple wallets within one wallet. This is definitely a game changer for me and for that reason I love this wallet the most. Aside from that there are so many features are provided by Eternl that is not provided with the rest. You can lock your wallet out so you do not accidentally interact with any smart contarcts, you can do swaps in the wallet, you have detailed graphics for your ADA distrubutions for each epoch and so much more!"
2/20/2023,"Contingent Staking (CS) is like a red rag on a bull for many members of the community. These people are trying to defend the basic principles of public blockchain networks, of which Cardano is clearly one. Opponents believe that KYC required by some SPOs will lead to some principles being violated and Cardano could gradually become a centralized network. The heated debate about Contingent Staking is not so much about the technology as it is about the philosophy of the project and Satoshi's legacy. If you think about the very basic principles of blockchain technology, you will find that CS does not fundamentally violate any of them. I'll try to convince you of that.

# TLDR

* Contingent Staking mostly interferes with the definition of permissionless, as SPOs requesting delegator’s data become gatekeepers.
* No one can centrally dictate to SPOs how to manage their policies related to delegations. Cardano remains permissionless.
* The delegators’ market demand for non-KYC pools will be stronger than the powers of the authority. The market will influence what kind of pools will emerge.
* Authorities cannot gain control of Cardano through SPOs as control is held by ADA holders.
* Preventing the introduction of a new feature on the basis of ideology or philosophy may lead to a violation of the principle of openness.
* Contingent Staking is designed to be completely trustless.
* We need to be smart in our fight against the current financial world. The CS feature can help us.

55. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”.

59. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)

61. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano.

63. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

When I'm using the djed if I connect my Eternl or other walltet it doesn't sum all addresses and doesn't show my SHEN or the total amount of Ada since they are split into multiple addresses generated from my private key.  


Is this an issue with Djed app? Is there something I can do about it?

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
2/20/2023, im using yoroi for my ada and its been sitting there for couple of years. makes me want to transfer since it hasnt been updating and been seeing all bad rep from new users.
2/20/2023,"Please can someone tell me what LOCKED DEPOSIT: means o a Shelly era Yoroi wallet app on IOS, I’m guessing it either says this on all wallets and is standard or other and if the latter is like it explaining please!"
2/20/2023,"Hello, I used Daedalus for years, but it seems that moving from 4.8 to 5.2 version finally resulted in the wallet not syncing.

I don't have time to troubleshoot and OK to move to a light wallet, however, I have the following questions:

1. If i restore to eternl or Yoroi, will ALL subaccounts transfer as well?
...it seems that my ADA and tokens such as MELD and GENS are spread around multiple UTXO/subaccounts right now.

2. I could see these when i was using Daedalus and was getting a ""consolidated"" ADA number (total) in my named account without going from subaccount to subaccount.

Would I also see it (total ADA number as well as MELD, GENS) in Eternl/Yoroi?

Thanks."
2/20/2023,"I received some random asset in my nami wallet called tesla.

It annoys me to see it there and i want to get rid of it.

I could just send it away but i know on other blockchains there are tokens which get airdropped and can somehow hack your account if you interact with them. So I am apprehensive to interact with it?

Has anyone heard of these types of scams on Cardano?"
2/19/2023,Wondering what this is at for people. I've been staking for about 18 months and mine's at 3.5%. Is this on the low end? I've had a few epochs where I've earned nothing so I'm guessing that's why it's under the target of 4-5. I also don't understand the mechanics well so feel free to educate me.
2/19/2023,"I been using yoroi for a couple years now and no major problems except maybe the load time gets a little slow sometimes. But i hear that the developers stop support on yoroi, is that a major problem? what's the difference with a wallet that has continuous support vs a wallet that has no support?

&#x200B;

edit: my question is not a suggestion for a new wallet but the difference in continuous support vs non, is it just the speed?

edit 2: my question is not a suggestion for a new wallet but the difference in continuous support vs non, is it just the speed?

2/19/2023,"Hi all, I have some ADA staked using Yoroi since 2021. I paid taxes on the rewards last year even though I didn't withdraw, based on the info available at the time.

I've seen mixed messages on Reddit and Google for the current rules. Is it still the consensus that a US ADA holder should report staking rewards from the previous year even if they have not been withdrawn?"
2/19/2023,"I have always wanted to start my own stake pool but with ADA getting lower in value is it worth investing and making a stake pool? 

Stake pools are not easy as a lot of marketing will be needed to get people involved and if there aren't 1 million ADA delegated then blocks will not be minted very epoch thus making it less feasible. Are there any stake pool operators here? If so can you guys help me out and shoot some information in my direction? 

Thank you so much in advance."
2/19/2023,"Hi, something unusual happened to me today when claiming ledger rewards through yoroi. It wouldn't let me do it with the nano with plus and asked for the old device nano s. It listed both device factory numbers and rejected the first asking for the second. I connected it and i got my rewards in the ledger account. i have no problems with nano s plus and i receive and send cardano. maybe i should cancel the delegation entirely with nano s and make a new one with nano s plus? that's the only thing i can think of. but then what if break your old ledger and can't claim your rewards? I'm confused because this is wrong and it shouldn't be. Once I have the private keys imported on a new device this shouldn't happen. What do you say?"
2/19/2023,"I'm trying to get my tax documents ready and I believe I used pooltool last year to get my staking rewards info in a csv file. When I try to log in to pooltool now, it's saying I need to verify my wallet by sending a small amount of ADA. 

I don't see any transaction history indicating that I did this last year. Is it possible I used another app to get my staking info or is this a new ask by pooltool?"
2/19/2023,Looking at other projects like Algorand I found strange that the ada native wallets doesn’t provide a direct option to buy/sell/covert ada without going through crazy exchange fees. Or is there a way?
2/19/2023,"# Explaining the NFT Price Evaluation

In the past weeks we have publicly launched a Machine Learning-powered service that aims to provide a fair value estimation of NFTs. In this article we are going to see how we approached this specific task, and what lays ahead.

## The Context

It is all but obvious how to evaluate an NFT. In fact, there are thousands of collections, each with its specific traits. Some trait combinations are rarer than others and, usually, rarer assets are characterized by higher prices; however, there is no unique way of computing rarity, as it is reflected by the fact that there are at least two well-known ways of doing it, called “rarity” and “statistical rarity”.  


https://preview.redd.it/zw1t3kq2j7ja1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=015455acd402b012b960295bf5f0d675596fbfea

A trial in this direction was performed by the “floor price” computation, which can provide you with a lower bound of the asset value, but how high should you go with respect to that bound when you decide to list your asset? This assumed that you should do it in first place because, maybe, your asset is way more common than all the others listed, so you may define the new floor yourself. In this case the question should be: how low should you go with respect to the floor? There is no objective answer to these questions, and this is under the hypothesis that a floor value exists. In fact, what if your asset has some trait that is so rare that 0 assets, among those listed, display it? Which floor should you choose? These are all open questions, and the only way for answering them so far has been to use personal experience. Personal experience, however, has three limitations: first, it takes a lot of time and effort to be built; second, it is affected by personal biases; third, while building it, you may end up doing mistakes, which could cost you a lot. This is why we decided to throw Machine Learning (ML) into the equation.

ML is a branch of computer science in which softwares are instructed with examples, rather than rules. This is the same that happens to the human brain: we do not learn to drive or swim just by reading a handbook; we need practice. This is why it is called “Machine Learning”. ML, however, is not the magic wand that you can shake around and make things happen. ML needs data, and data need to be clean, understandable, and meaningful. Just like you would not teach your child History by randomly jumping between epochs and continents, you cannot just give raw data to an ML model and pretend that it learns. There’s no way around hard work. So how do you teach it?  


[Listings and Sales spread example](https://preview.redd.it/8hc1kuw3j7ja1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27ae8aac6cc024e10d2cf4295153f873145464c3)

The closest scenario to NFT evaluation is real estate evaluation. Real estates and NFTs have many things in common. For starting, they both are illiquid assets. Houses are characterized by traits as well (surface, year of construction, energy rating, number of rooms…), and, like NFTs, not all trait combinations are available. Some real estates can be staked (rented). Plus, they are (in most cases) clustered in collections (cities), within which the evaluations share a set of rules.

House pricing evaluation, however, is a trivial problem. In fact:  
1. real estates distribution is a function of two clear parameters, latitude and longitude;  
2. real estates are priced by agencies, which have well defined criteria to perform the evaluation, which results in a small scatter of the data;  
3. the said criteria are the result of a general consensus and are human-understandable.

When an agency has to evaluate the price of a real estate, they first check the unit prices of the houses in the same area. Second, they average them in order to have a robust estimation. Finally, they correct the price of the house they are evaluating for its specificities (quiet location +10%, not very bright -10%, surrounded by nature +20%…).

The same cannot be done for NFTs. In fact:  
1. they have no obvious metric that one should use to compute their distance;  
2. there is no agency rating NFTs according to well-defined criteria, so the scatter between assets sharing common traits can be \*huge\*;  
3. in most cases, it is not understandable why some trait should be more appealing than others (set aside for their rarity).

So how can the problem be tackled?

## Our Approach

Having chosen to use the power of ML to help us solve this challenge, the first step was to decide how to deal with overfitting. What is it? In short, if we assume that the information provided by our data points is made of two components:

1. signal, which is what we want to fit;  
2. noise, which is the product of random processes;

Overfitting means to fit the noise alongside with the signal. This, of course, is a bad idea because it would teach the model something wrong, which can lead to catastrophic failures. from Wikipedia’s page about [\[overfitting\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting), shows the phenomenon very well. The black line is the right fit, the blue line is the overfitted one.

&#x200B;

[Overfitting Illustration](https://preview.redd.it/d2s6vxh5j7ja1.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8886124882c83920f570567b5d5e0454b51a4a59)

Most ML models tend to overfit, and this is particularly true for Neural Networks. In our case, overfitting would have led the model to provide excellent or nearly perfect evaluations for the listed assets, and to spectacularly fail for those not for sale. In order to avoid this, we decided to take a gradual approach. We started with a simple model, and we evaluated its performances, favoring quality over quantity (namely, better to reproduce well just a handful of collections than to reproduce well a few of them and badly many others); then we started a loop in which we identify what is not working properly, we increase the model complexity in order to overcome the limitations, and we evaluate the improvements.

Our goal is to repeat this procedure as many times as it is required to converge to a model capable of being as universal as it could aim at being. In practice, we chose the “slow and steady” philosophy, instead of “move fast and break things”, and we are developing the model in such a way that every new release is a superset of the previous one. Namely, if something works well, it will keep on working well or will work even better; and if something does not work, it may start to work.

The second challenge we had to face was to provide the user with the confidence intervals that he/she could use to evaluate the work of the model. Avoiding to add the error bars/confidence intervals is probably the most common mistake in ML. In fact, all ML is built atop the assumption that the goal should be to create the model that maximizes some score which expresses the quality of the inference. Of course, maximizing the score is important, but having a model that returns a number and being unable to quantity the uncertainty associated to it can be dangerous in many situations. Imagine that you have to undergo a heart transplantation and there is an ML model that predicts that you have 99% chance to survive the operation. 99% is a pretty high number, but what if there is an error bar of +0.9/-90%? If your true value can fall anywhere between 10% and 99.9%, then that 99% value does not look so promising anymore because the final outcome is, basically, the flip of a coin. Same if you are find that an asset is undervalued by 90%, but the inference model unreliable. This is why we have created the five classes:  
— underpriced;  
— cheap;  
— fair;  
— expensive;  
— overpriced;  


[Example of valuation classes display on cnftjungle.io](https://preview.redd.it/vdguvcc7j7ja1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8adef2232ee98e7728e54ee0a856ea0bb0642331)

and this is why we have also enriched the inference with two further values:  
— goodness of fit;  
— tightness of fit.

The goodness of fit tells you how well the model performed with respect to the global point distribution. If the goodness of fit is rated “excellent”, it means that both globally and locally the model works well at reproducing what it sees; if is below excellent, local deviations are possible, so the estimations should be taken with two pinches of salt (the first because the predictions are not financial advices, and the second because the model cannot fully adapt to what it sees).

The tightness of fit, instead, tells you how scattered data points are with respect to the best fit. Data points can be highly scattered, and yet the fit can be excellent, this is absolutely possible; it is the opposite that is not valid. Namely, the tightness of fit will always be compatible or worse than the goodness of fit. The tightness of fit can tell you how relevant local deviations are, when the fit is sub-excellent, and, when the fit is excellent, how wide the margin of opportunity could be.

Finally, the last challenge to address is market manipulation. How to avoid it? Stated that there is no such a thing as a fool-proof algorithm, we have been well aware of this issue since the beginning of our work and we have taken precautions, just like we have done for the rest. No further detail will be shared about this, in order not to help malicious entities crack the algorithm. What we can say is that further steps will be taken in the future, to make this chance less and less likely as the service increases its popularity.

## Future Prospects

This all brings us to the most exciting part: what lays ahead?

Having a reliable model for NFT price determination offers a wide range of opportunities of which nobody probably has ever taken advantage of. We have started with the sniping function that allows you to find the most undervalued asset within some specific collection, but this is merely scratching the surface. In fact, so far we have compute the undervaluation as the ratio between the listing price and the estimated fair value (relative undervaluation), but a valid alternative could be to use the difference between the two of them (absolute undervaluation).

Moving on, more complex queries could be possible. In fact, the search could be enriched by adding more and more criteria, like conditions on the traits, rarity rankings, price or profit boundaries. For example, a search could look like: “find the 10 most undervalued assets with a potential profit of 200+ ADA between the collections A, B, and C. For collection A, consider only those assets with trait \*x\* having one of the following values: x1, x3, x4. For collection B exclude the asset number 12. For collection C consider only the assets with a rarity rank below 1,000”. This would be a paradigm shift in the sniping experience. But things could be moved even further.

Imagine to have 10,000 ADA that you want to invest in NFTs. Despite the possibility of creating queries like the one described above, it would take a lot of time to allocate the funds between 50, 100 or 200 different assets. If only there was a better way… Well, there is. The optimal capital allocation could be vastly automated with the help of optimization algorithms. You could pass the interface further constraints, like “I want my capital be divided between at most 100 assets from at least 5 collections”, “I do not want more than 30 assets per collection”, and “the cheapest asset must be worth at least 30 ADA”. The algorithm would run and you would get the best capital allocation strategy that it found according to your criteria. At this point you would be able to interact with these data and choose, for example, which assets to keep and which to discard, then you could add further constraints, or you could modify the existing ones, and move to the next iteration. This way, what would be a very complex and time-consuming procedure could be reduced to a series of clicks.

And now the icing on the cake. What we have seen so far allows you to scout for the best opportunities offered by the market right now, but it does not help you to determine whether investing in a particular collection may or not may be profitable with the perspective of N months in the future. In fact, the price distribution is constantly changing, and assets can change category more quickly than many could sell them (this is especially true for the most expensive ones). In order to mitigate this risk, we are also planning to trace the fair value changes with time for feeding them to forecasting models. This could (here the conditional is imperative) allow us to quantify the probability that a specific collection will appreciate in time, therefore adding a further layer of confidence to the sniping experience.

There would be so much more to say about our future plans, but here we stop: we do not want to give you too many spoilers. Please, note that this section does not constitute a roadmap: things may be implemented in a different order than the one hinted here, or may not be implemented at all (either due to contingent factors or to technical difficulties). However, we are boiling with ideas and, if you liked what we have done so far, you will love what lays ahead. Finally, none of this is a financial advice. We do not endorse investing in any particular collection, or asset. We encourage you to think with your own head, do your own research, and take full responsibility of your choices. The good part of this is that, when they are right, you have the credit.

Stay tuned, hunters. More awesomeness to come!"
2/19/2023,"Recently I got a new phone my previous phone had a Shelly wallet on it the app was Yoroi i believe, anyway long story shortish when I’d set up new phone there were no ada in the wallets balance.

First step I tried recovery with the seeds and password it created a wallet but no balance, since the I have tried to also do the process again on IOS phone but each time it said wallet already exists so I cancelled the process.

Next I downloaded the windows browser extension Yoroi wallet page and then created a wallet with the seed phrases hoping it would restore the balance and it didn’t.

Does anyone know what the issue is here because it seems nightly complicated to restore compared to other crypto coins.

Any advise welcome indeed!"

https://preview.redd.it/5s49vd33zzia1.png?width=1936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=786629adac1bd43626fb50cb5a109f89df940d6d

Community-led initiatives are a great way to get comfortable and immersed in various topics/events across the ecosystem. Catalyst Swarm warmly welcomes you to the community workshop to discuss in depth [CIP1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380). This event already took place but [recordings will be available on the Catalyst Swarm YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@catalystswarm/videos). I am sure there will be more opportunities to come.

The Session started with a general discussion in the main room and eventually broke off into several breakout rooms to focus on specific items and topics around CIP 1694: SPOs, Constitution, dReps to name a few. 

The goal is to identify major areas of CIP 1694 which require community thoughts and perspectives and further attention to ensure an effective rollout and implementation of CIP 1694.

You can also get some additional perspectives from these videos:

* [Army of Spies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWFZYgmiAg)
* [Jspeak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXM1Pxd0hgQ)
* [QA DAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe9XvezpdbI)

On a related theme, next week, a number of SPOs and developers (including some from the Catalyst community) will attend a focused technical workshop in Colorado (run by the Cardano Foundation and IOG) to review the mechanics of CIP 1694, the first in a number of community consultations planned for this year. Full meeting minutes will be published after the event for further community engagement and feedback. If you wish to add your perspectives to CIP 1694, you can find it [here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380). Make sure you add your voice as the era of Voltaire rolls out!

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

https://preview.redd.it/5tn0bu96zzia1.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30483358c0e229dfc260fdc48a8b7f2087688739

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems. The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

# Workshops for funded projects

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cejog2w7zzia1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=573a2990871a29f23003261e1105a99b106449ed

We recently hit the 400+ completed project milestone and with more projects coming into the Catalyst ecosystem with each funding round, there is a need for education for more projects to leverage in their journeys.  


In the coming weeks and months, the Catalyst team will facilitate technical and business growth workshops with players within and outside the Catalyst ecosystem. These workshops aim to provide educational resources tailored to some of the pain points faced by very early-stage blockchain startups and projects building within the Cardano ecosystem.  


The first of these will happen on the 21st of February, this event is open to all Catalyst-funded projects. The workshops will take place on the bi-weekly Coordinator call at 5 PM UTC. The topic of this first workshop will be **Business Models For Disruptive Tech Organizations** presented by Edify Collab’s [**Harry Hellyer**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harryhellyer/). If you are a funded project, make sure to check your emails or announcement channels for the invites.  


Ultimately, a workshop calendar will be released in the coming weeks so funded projects can anticipate future sessions and bookmark the time slots in their individual calendars.

# Last week in CIPs 

https://preview.redd.it/fy67brh9zzia1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fddd6cdc41af27be2d97cf1567a3230d1b15564a

Here's the recap from my colleague [Ryan Williams](https://twitter.com/Ryun1_) that writes these fantastic CIP round-ups. I figured you'd like them, too. So here's the latest to get up to speed. You can catch past and future summaries [via this Cardano forum thread here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/what-happened-in-cips-last-week/109101) as well. If are unsure what CIPs are about - please check out this link to dive deeper: [https://cips.cardano.org/](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). 

**RW:** What happened in CIPs last week?

* [CIP-???? | Add Untyped UPLC builtin functions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/459) **\[New CIP Proposal\]**:
   * This proposal suggests replacing or enhancing the set of Plutus Core built-in functions with built-in functions that are untyped.

**RW:** Continued Recommendations:

* [CIP-81 | Tiered Pricing](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/381):
   * This proposal offers a specification for how to introduce tiered transaction fee pricing to Cardano.
   * This is a good read.
* [CIP-0039? | Language annotated address](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/310):
   * This proposal suggests adding additional annotations to addresses containing script hashes, so that native and Plutus script addresses can be differentiated.

**RW:** CIP Editors Meeting #61 (Tuesday 14th) 

* [CPS-03 | Smart Tokens](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/382):
   * Should remove solution parts from the problem statement.
   * Parts of the rejected CIP-70 are to be merged in as these are closely aligned.
* Draft [CPS-???? | Wallet UX](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/454):
   * Some interesting ideas included - around shortcomings of CIP-30.
   * No response from the author to comments in three weeks - this should be closed for now.
* [CIP-???? | Sums-of-products in Plutus Core](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/455):
   * Author present to discuss.
   * All comments have been responded to.
   * Will move to the last check for the next meeting.
* [CIP-???? | Ledger evolution (meta)](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/456):
   * Keen to have this merged.
   * Not too much discussion around this - but that is the nature of meta proposals.
   * Moved to last check for the next call.
* [CIP-???? | NFT Metadata Update Oracles](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/430):
   * No major disputes are present in this well-articulated proposal.
   * Asked the author to be present for the following meeting to discuss.
* [CIP-???? | Maybe Datum](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/440):
   * This is waiting for the author to respond to comments.
   * This is ready to have a number applied in the meantime.
   * Further reviews would be good.
* [CIP-???? | Post Quantum signatures in Plutus](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/441):
   * Author was present and a long healthy discussion was had around this.
   * Main question for this proposal: is it worth doing this now or in future?
   * Perhaps need a domain expert to weigh in along with the Plutus team.
   * Maybe a CPS could be added.

**Next Meeting:**

* CIP Editors Meeting #62:
   * Tentatively: Feb 28th 9:30am UTC.
* Held on Discord - [here](https://discord.gg/4yukWV3khD).
* Agenda TBD.

2/18/2023,"There seems to be a sudden and overwhelming concern that Cardano is going to just give absolute and total control of the protocol over to the governments and regulatory agencies of the world, thereby utterly destroying the entire system in one fell swoop; but the undeniable fact is that Cardano was designed and architected from the very beginning with laws, regulations, and the general need for financial oversight in mind, all while recognizing the need for the system to remain trustless and decentralized...

https://why.cardano.org/en/introduction/regulation-intro/

> Like all financial systems, the Cardano protocol must have an opinion in its design over what is fair and reasonable. We have chosen to divide between individual rights and the rights of a marketplace.
>
> Individuals should always have sole access to their funds without coercion or civil asset forfeiture. This right has to be enforced because not all governments can be trusted...
>
> Second, history should never be tampered with. Blockchains provide a promise of immutability.
>
> Third, the flow of value should be unrestricted. Capital controls and other artificial walls diminish human rights.
>
> These principles stated, markets are distinctly different from individuals. While the designers of Cardano believe in individual rights, _we also believe that markets have the right to openly state their terms and conditions, and if an individual agrees to do business within this market, then they must be held to those standards for the sake of integrity of the entire system._

Notice that last part I italicized? That's the exact philosophy of Contingent Staking stated as a core part of Cardano's foundational ethos...

These were just a few excerpts; if you've never read, or even skimmed, the whole essay (and, clearly, some of you haven't) you really should."
2/18/2023,"I was curious If I get my staking rewards on top of that earning from supplying ADA to liqwid protocol?

If no, do I need to stake to a special staking pool?
Or what is the way? I mean they always told we getting lending rewards AND staking rewards.

Dont know If I just missed the explaining, but couldnt find anything in detail for that!

Thanks"

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
2/18/2023,"Why did cardano go with sidechains and not modular approach like shared security on top of L1/L0? 
Why not minimal smart contract on the settlement layer for security and data availability? 

Why not build network off networks to avoid sidechains for security reasons?"
2/17/2023,"Contingent Staking (CS) is a proposal to extend the delegation process. SPOs would be able to request information from potential delegators and decide whether to accept or reject the delegation based on provided data. This functionality is misinterpreted as introducing a KYC process at the first layer. This is a misconception as it is only an extension of the existing process and SPOs will not be forced to use it. Contingent Staking can be a win for Cardano as it will extend its functionality with a capability that can bring greater adoption, liquidity, and usage. All of Cardano's key characteristics such as decentralization, censorship resistance, openness, and accessibility to everyone on the planet without third-party consent will be preserved.

# TLDR

* ADA holders will probably not delegate to pools requiring KYC. They have to arrange delegations differently. 
* Fiat money and the internet serve both good and bad people. Cardano should be the same. 
* More versatility will bring more ways to use Cardano.
* Cardano is not a tool of one group to fight fiat currencies or states.
* Contingent Staking does not disrupt the key characteristics of Cardano.
* If there is a demand to delegate coins to a pool that does not require KYC, such pools will arise.
* ADA holders will decide on the implementation of Contingent Staking through a vote.

# Contingent Staking

Contingent Staking is intended to extend the delegation certificate to allow the insertion of extra information. This can be contact details, KYC information, or whatever. If the SPO takes advantage of this option, the delegation will go through the multi-signature process. Both delegators and SPOs must sign the transaction for the delegation of coins to the pool to occur. SPOs can define their terms of use. There may be a cooperation contract between the SPO and the delegator.

 I want to start using a dex and despite watching numerous YouTube videos I’m still at a bit of a loss. 

The question. If I want to just leave my Cardano on a dex without touching it for say a year what would be the best and safest option? I’m liking the look of wingriders and muesli but I also took part in the Genius Yield / Genius X SPO. 

Would it be best to wait for Genius Yield? FYI I don’t have a large amount just a bit to play around with. 

Don’t bother sending PMs asking me to link my wallet to dodgy sites you’ll be politely told to FUCK OFF! 

TIA for any genuine advice 😃"
2/17/2023,"So, I made this game a while ago but I don't think many people know about it. Basically there are 12 riddles, the answers are one of the words in the BIP39 word list, if you guess the answers correctly you can restore the wallet and claim the funds. When you get all the words correct the background turns to pixel art gold coins and the chest opens, so its pretty easy to tell that you've solved it. It might be too hard? This is still the first set of riddles and no one has solved it yet.

36. Having watched Martin throughout the '90s and Bad Boys (about a million times), it's surreal & amazing to see that the content is interesting to a guy who entertained me so much.

[https://twitter.com/StakeWithPride/status/1623064762610499586](https://twitter.com/StakeWithPride/status/1623064762610499586)

54. Looks like Kraken was the first staking target of the SEC. [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25)
55. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world. [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648)
56. Rumors are that other exchanges & stablecoin providers will receive letters outlining charges soon. One posted rumor is mentioning Circle (USDC) & Paxos specifically. [https://twitter.com/AP\_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322](https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322)
57. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem. [https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656](https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656)
58. Charles posted a reply to Brian Armstrong’s staking tweet that savagely highlights the regulatory problem with Ethereum’s custodial/slashing based staking. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1623530227870896130](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1623530227870896130)
59. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)
60. Now the SEC is going after Binance USD stablecoin issuer, Paxos. [https://archive.ph/nrgeU](https://archive.ph/nrgeU)
61. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano. [https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457](https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457)

63. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

65. Here’s a fantastic thread by Sooraj explaining the huge innovative leap forward provided by Ouroboros Genesis for dynamic participation in proof-of-stake systems and making Cardano more secure than Ethereum or Algorand.

71. The messaging against the energy use in Bitcoin is fully ramping up now courtesy of Bloomberg and the Harold and Kumar guy.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all"
2/17/2023,"[https://worldmobile.co.tz/](https://worldmobile.co.tz/) is the first B2C site coming online from WMT!!! Congratulations  WMT Team!!

I had a quick look at the site to see the data plan prices and they are really cheap. Good Job!

Just to play with some numbers:

Unique Users: \~25k

Costliest Data plan: 30Gb of data with 90 days validity. Cost: 25000 tshs (\~$10.64)

So assuming everyone goes for this data plan, we are looking at:

4 (qrts) \* 25000 (users) \* $10.64 (30Gb\_90Days) = **$1.06 Million/Year**

This is with 25k users, which i am assuming will grow exponentially over the next few months!

In addition, WMT is going to duplicate this success in 2 more countries in Africa.

In addition, WMT is going to expand in one of the Asian country!

In addition, WMT is going to expand in USA!

This is one of the few projects that has an organic fiat ramp which does not involve crypto in the forefront. The users of WMT data plan would never even know or care that WMT runs on crypto blockchain! 

Well done WMT team. Wish you all the very best!!!!"
2/17/2023,Hello: Tax season time in USA and I'm having syncing issues with my Cardano wallelt stored in Ledger with Koinly. It seems to happen every upgrade.  It shows an incorrect balance. Anyone else having this issue? I use API.
